Color plays a crucial role in visualization by enhancing readability, guiding viewer attention, and improving comprehension. It helps differentiate data sets, highlights important information, and conveys meaning through associations (like red for danger or green for go). Effective use of color in titles, typography, and borders not only makes the visual more aesthetically pleasing but also helps organize information, making it easier for the audience to follow and understand the visual hierarchy and relationships within the data

Using commas in large figures enhances readability and comprehension by breaking the number into smaller, manageable groups. This makes it easier to quickly understand the scale and magnitude of the numbers at a glance. For example, the number 1000000 is more readily understood as 1,000,000, where the commas help visually segment the figure into millions, thousands, and hundreds. This formatting aligns with our natural tendency to process and remember information in chunks, aiding in faster and more accurate interpretation of data
