🔄 Keep Your Power BI Reports Up-to-Date: Creating a Refresh Time DAX Measure 🕒

Want to make sure your users are always aware of the last refresh date of your Power BI reports? Here’s a quick guide on creating a "Refresh Time" DAX measure:

Three Use Cases with DAX Examples
Current Refresh Time

DAX
Copy code
Refresh Time = NOW()
This measure captures the current date and time whenever the data is refreshed.

Data Point-Based Refresh Date

DAX
Copy code
Refresh Date = MAX('Table'[Date])
This measure keeps users aware of the maximum date from the data points, indicating the latest date covered by the data rather than the actual refresh time.

Refresh Time from Power Query
Similar to the first option but set up in Power Query for convenience and consistency across reports.

Steps to Implement
Format the Measure: Choose a suitable date-time format to clearly display the refresh date and time.
Add the Measure to Your Report: Drag and drop the newly created "Refresh Time" measure onto your report canvas. Use a card visualization to prominently display the refresh date.
