See, I'm not a professional magician or tarot reader, IN PLAYYING CARDS: we can't choose the hand we're dealt, but we can determine how we play it."

Good evening, Toastmaster and esteemed guests,

I know you might be thinking, "Oh no, not another motivational speech," but bear with me for a moment. Allow me to share a story. In my home, we have an electric meter that needs topping up every month British Gas pre-pay meter now, unless you opt for a Â£200 credit which lasts a couple of months depending on usage. I would often visit the nearest shop which is like some 100 or 200 meterest, where I encountered a lady full of energy, with a welcoming smile at the till. She engaged with customers, personalized interactions, and entertained with her sharp wit. Sharing my experience at the till, you know, you encounter very few people who may frown or appear lethargic, not even bothering to pass a smile, which is often disappointing.

However, there was a problem. When I asked her to top up my electricity card, it took ages. It's a straightforward task, something that should only take a couple of minutes, yet she would wait for another staff member to assist. This became a pattern. Every time I went, she asked me to wait, not just me, but other customers too, until the issue was resolved. I always wondered why she couldn't grasp this basic instruction. But this went on for years. I would patiently wait at the shop until it was sorted because there was no other place that provided this service.

To cut a long story short, on a recent visit, I noticed a new person, almost the same age, and expected the same wait. To my surprise, the task was completed with the snap of a finger. When I inquired about the previous employee, I was told she had left. I know you may be intrigued to know the reasons behind her departure, but I'll leave that to your imagination.

Ladies and gentlemen, like the tale of playing cards and the lady at the till,

Like the tale of playing cards and the lady at the till, both stories underscore the notion that in life, we are dealt certain hands or faced with certain situations that we cannot control. However, our response and actions in navigating these circumstances ultimately determine our outcomes and experiences. Just as in a game of cards where we can't choose our hand but can control our strategy, so too in our interactions with others, we may encounter challenges beyond our control, yet we have the power to influence how we handle them.
