Power BI Dashboard: NHS Digital Mental Health Statistics 2022-23

We’re excited to unveil a new Power BI dashboard that visualizes mental health statistics from NHS Digital for 2022-23. This dashboard is a remake of the previous Commons Library Parliament UK report, but with improvements—only regions with relevant data are shown, and areas like Wales and Scotland that have no values are excluded.

By focusing on areas with actual data, this dashboard provides a clearer, more focused view of how mental health services are accessed across different regions. It’s an easy-to-navigate tool that brings key insights to the forefront, helping us make more informed decisions.
