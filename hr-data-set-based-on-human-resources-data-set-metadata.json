Hence I created a synthetic one.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data simulates a typical Business environment dataset related to Human Resources information. It contains 3 data sets:\n1. Employee data, with information like, name, Date of Birth, Date of hire, Department, etc.\n2. Action data, indicating actions like, hiring, promotions, demotions, attrition.\n3. Performance data. For each employee for each period.\n\nThe 3 data set can be related through the Employee ID.\nThe current data set spans over 10 periods (2015-2024) with an average active employees of 1000 per year. \nThe replacement rate (new hire and attrition) is set to be about 5% per year.  \nThe age of employment is coherent with the typical distribution of ages.\nThe likelihood of promotions is linked to performance rate.\n\nThere are 2 planted biases in the data:\n- A Gender Bias (Female(1) employees tend to get better performance ratings)\n- A Race Bias (Asians (1) are more likely to be promoted)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe original work was inspired by the excellent data set provided here \nhttps://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIs this a good simulation of values we could expect? Are there systematic anomalies? If so which ones?\nAre the biases statistically significant\n\nI wrote the program to generate the dataset in VBA. I am working to prepare a Python version of it. It\u0027s available for free upon request and though GitHub. \nI am happy to collaborate further on this project.  \nAny feedback is more then welcome! Please share and spread the word :)"}
