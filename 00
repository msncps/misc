So, here's a story of how the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (aka frequency illusion) smacked me in the face—more than once, I might add. Picture this: during uni, one of my professors introduces this case study on a Zen car. No, not the “finding inner peace” kind of Zen. This was a bright yellow Suzuki Zen, fresh off the assembly line, with only about 500 of them zipping around India. You couldn’t miss it even if you tried. This car was so yellow, it could make a daffodil blush. And there I was, innocently learning about it in class, thinking I’d never see one in real life.

But then, the universe decided to play a little game with me. Every time I flew between Mumbai and Delhi, that yellow Zen was just… there. Every. Single. Time. It didn’t matter that there were only a few hundred in existence—those cars suddenly became the bane of my existence. You know that feeling when you hear a new word and suddenly everyone and their grandma is saying it? Yeah, that's Baader-Meinhof in action.

Now fast forward to last year. I was driving my son to basketball practice, cruising on the M25 like I owned the road. I was feeling the wind in my hair (okay, not really, because windows up), doing a respectable 57 mph on an average-speed camera stretch, thinking I’m all good. Spoiler alert: I was not. A few days later, I received a speeding ticket. Painful? Yes. £90 fine and a self-awareness driving class. That’s like paying to be told I suck at driving—ouch.

Determined not to get caught again, I vowed to drive like an absolute saint. But apparently, being a saint isn’t as easy as it sounds. I had to pick my son up from Tunbridge Wells, and I was running late. So I decided to speed things up a bit on a road I’ve used a hundred times before. Surely, nothing could go wrong, right? WRONG. I got not one, but TWO speeding tickets in the mail, and they’d been sitting on my wife’s desk for weeks. She forgot to tell me! Like a double-whammy from the universe.

At this point, I’m fuming. I’m done with speeding fines and decide to play it extra safe. Fast forward to a few weeks later—I’m driving back from Nottingham after my daughter’s ACL surgery. It’s midnight, I’m exhausted, my wife’s in the backseat chatting with relatives in India, and my daughter’s resting her leg in the front. Suddenly, I see flashing lights. A police car has been tailing me for the last 15 minutes. “What now?” I think.

He’s flashing his lights, so I pull over on the hard shoulder, annoyed but confused. Why is this guy on my case? I get out of the car, and the officer yells at me to get back inside like I’m some kind of criminal mastermind. Inside, my wife and daughter are screaming at me, asking if I’ve paid the insurance and road tax. “YES,” I shout back, wondering if this is real life.

Turns out, the cop wasn’t chasing me for speeding. No, no. He gave me a ticket for driving too slow in the middle lane. At midnight. With no other cars around. On a motorway.

Moral of the story? If something absurd like the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon happens once, expect it to happen again. But when it happens with speeding tickets… well, maybe it’s time to rethink your driving habits.
