Let me tell you about how life, in the form of the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, decided to slap me in the face—not just once, but repeatedly. Imagine this: back in uni, my professor brings up a case study on the Suzuki Zen. For those who don’t know, this was a 5-door hatchback, launched in the 90s, in the most eye-popping jelly bean yellow you could imagine. Only 500 of these bad boys were released into the wild, mostly in affluent Indian metros like Mumbai and Delhi.

Now, every time I flew between Mumbai and Delhi, I’d spot one of these bright yellow Zens. Every. Single. Time. I mean, there were only 500 of them, but I swear they multiplied every time I looked away. You know that feeling when you learn a new word and suddenly it’s everywhere? Yeah, that’s Baader-Meinhof, making me feel like I was being stalked by tiny yellow hatchbacks.

Fast forward to last year. I’m driving my son to basketball practice on the M25, feeling like a champ. I’m cruising at a cool 57 mph on a 50 mph average-speed camera stretch. I felt the wind in my hair (metaphorically, of course—it’s the M25, not a beachside road). I thought I was safe. Well, I thought wrong. A few days later, I’m greeted by a love letter from the DVLA—a £90 speeding ticket and an invitation to their exclusive "Offender Retraining" class. Nothing like paying to be told you’re driving wrong.

Determined to never get caught again, I vowed to be the world’s most cautious driver. But fate had other plans. A few weeks later, I had to pick up my son from Tunbridge Wells, running late, naturally. I hit the A20, a road I’ve driven a hundred times before. Except this time, there was a sneaky new 40mph limit thanks to Transport for London and their safety concerns over surface water flooding. But who cares? I mean, I’m a pro now, right? Wrong.

Weeks later, I find not one, but TWO speeding tickets sitting on my wife’s desk. She forgot to tell me, of course. Double trouble—two tickets, two fines, and I didn’t even know until it was too late. By this point, I’m wondering if I should just donate my salary directly to the police.

Now, the cherry on top. Fast forward again. I’m driving back from Nottingham after my daughter’s ACL surgery. It’s midnight, my wife’s in the backseat chatting with relatives in India (because apparently 5am is prime gossip time), and my daughter’s resting her leg in the front seat, casually scrolling Instagram. Then, out of nowhere, I see flashing lights. A police car has been tailing me for 20 minutes. I think, "What fresh hell is this?"

I pull over, confused and mildly annoyed. The officer approaches, lights still flashing, and yells at me to get back in the car. My wife and daughter start panicking. “Did you pay the insurance? The road tax?” “YES!” I reply, baffled.

Turns out, I wasn’t speeding. Oh no. I got a ticket for driving too slow in the middle lane. At midnight. On a deserted motorway. The only thing more absurd than that ticket was the fact that I had literally no clue what I’d done wrong.

So here’s the moral of the story: When the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon strikes, it’ll keep showing up to remind you of the weirdest things—like yellow cars. But when it comes to speeding tickets? Well, let’s just say I’ve learned my lesson: drive fast enough to avoid getting fined for being slow, but not so fast that the speed cameras turn me into their favorite pen pal.
