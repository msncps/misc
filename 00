So, here's a story of how the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (aka frequency illusion) smacked me in the face—more than once, I might add. Picture this: during uni, one of my professors introduces this case study on a Zen car.  Suzuki Zen is a 5-door hatchback launched in mid nineeteens. This was a bright jelly bean yellow color Suzuki Zen, fresh off the assembly line, with only about 500 of them zipping around India in some affluent metros. Every time I travel between Mumbai and Delhi, that yellow Zen was just… there. Every. Single. Time. It didn’t matter that there were only a few hundred in existence—those cars suddenly became the bane of my existence. You know that feeling when you hear a new word and suddenly everyone and their grandma is saying it? Yeah, that's Baader-Meinhof in action.

Now fast forward to last year. I was driving my son to basketball practice, cruising on the M25 like I owned the road. I was feeling the wind in my hair doing a respectable 57 mph on an average-speed camera stretch of 50 mph, thinking I’m all good. You don't have to guess what next. A few days later, I received a speeding ticket. Painful? Yes. £90 fine and DVLA Sponsored Offender Retraining driving class. 

Determined not to get caught again, I vowed to drive like an absolute saint. This time, I had to pick my son up from Tunbridge Wells, and I was running late. So I decided to speed things up a bit on a road which was 50 MPH. I’ve used a hundred times before, Transport for London (TfL) due to safety concerns over surface water flooding.in August dropped The restrictions from 70mph and 50mph to 40mph on few sections of the A20 Sidcup, and the Swanley Interchange.. Surely, nothing could go wrong, right? WRONG. I got not one, but TWO speeding tickets in the mail, and they’d been sitting on my wife’s desk for weeks. She forgot to tell me! Like a double-whammy from the universe.

At this point, I’m fuming. I’m done with speeding fines and decide to play it extra safe. Fast forward to a few weeks later—I’m driving back from Nottingham after my daughter’s ACL surgery. It’s midnight, I’m exhausted, my wife’s in the backseat chatting with relatives in India,.Can;t believe it what is there to spreak that very earlery moinring back in India. My daughter’s resting her leg in the front and watching friends sitcom and aimless scrolling her insgarm page. Suddenly, I see flashing lights. A police car has been tailing me for the last 15 - 20 minutes. “What now?” I think.I'm of the correct speech limits

He’s flashing his lights, so I pull over on the hard shoulder, annoyed but confused. Why is this guy on my back bloody hell? I get out of the car, and the officer yells at me to get back inside like I’m some kind of criminal mastermind. Inside, my wife and daughter are screaming at me, asking if I’ve paid the insurance and road tax. “YES,” I wondering what happening to me.

Turns out, the cop wasn’t chasing me for speeding. No, no. He gave me a ticket for driving too slow in the middle lane. At midnight. With no other cars around. On a motorway. A23, London-Brighton Road, connects Brighton to Gatwick Airport: 

Moral of the story? If something absurd like the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon happens once, expect it to happen again. But when it happens with speeding tickets… well, maybe it’s time to rethink your driving habits.
