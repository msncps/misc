I have reviewed the "Power BI Partner Showcase Design Guide 2019." Based on the information from this guide and your request for a Power BI Solution Design Document, I can create a new presentation or Word document following a similar structure.

The key sections for the new document would include:

Introduction and Business Value

Overview of the Power BI solution
Expected business value and goals
Solution Showcase

Target audience for the solution
Business problems addressed by the showcase
Key performance indicators (KPIs) and how they relate to annual goals
Data Compliance

Guidelines for handling confidential or proprietary data
Compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR)
Avoiding use of PII, proprietary data, or unsupported visuals
Design and Visualizations

Best practices for color usage, branding, layout, and text consistency
Selection of appropriate visualizations
Avoiding common pitfalls in UI/UX design
Use of advanced features like tooltips, bookmarks, and interactions
Evaluation Criteria

How the showcase will be evaluated (e.g., design, data compliance, UI/UX, and Power BI proficiency)
Examples of well-designed and poorly-designed visuals
Conclusion and Next Steps

Final remarks on the Power BI solution
Steps for deploying or presenting the solution
Would you like me to proceed with this structure and create a new presentation or Word document for you? If yes, please confirm the format (PPT or Word).
