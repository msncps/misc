Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lives a man named Manoj. An ordinary guy, leading a peaceful, loved bird watching, walk in woods—even some may say his life is boring, until everything got turned upside down by a force of nature. And that force of nature? My teenage daughter, Ananya.
Now, don’t get me wrong—I absolutely adore my daughter. She’s smart, incredibly talented, and a joy to be around. But in 2017, when she hit her teenage years, she was struck by a serious bug called "Ariana Grande Fever." For those who aren’t familiar, Ariana Grande is an American pop star whose very existence can transform an ordinary teenager into a bloody bouncing ball of fire. But things got worst when my daughter found out that Ariana was coming to our city.
Somehow, my daughter got her hands on an Ariana Grande poster, and that marked the beginning of her transformation. I remember the first time she screamed with excitement at the mere sight of that poster—I honestly thought she was having an anxiety attack and was just about to dial the NHS for an ambulance. But luckily, my wife stopped me. She’s an expert in teenage tantrums, thanks to her extensive training from -watching sitcoms on Netflix and YouTube!
Fast forward to the post-pandemic era, when the world hit the pause button and suddenly everyone was confined to their homes. My company decided to keep me locked inside with a truckload of gadgets, no longer needed to come to the office So there I was, just me, myself, and I—stuck in a never-ending domestic loop. To break the monotony, I began exploring music, slowly building a playlist that grew with each passing day. I found myself delving into Bollywood and Malayalam songs, and before I knew it, I become a passionate fan of a mesmerizing tunes of the legendary "Nightingale of the South," Chitra Chechi.
Her songs quickly became my daily anthem, each morning, I start my day by brewing a cup of coffee, and my laptop. As soon as work started, so did the melodies of Chitra. It became my secret source of joy, much like the thrill my daughter experiences when she blasts Ariana Grande music.
Even as the COVID saga slowly faded, my love for Chitra  songs remained steadfast. Feeling inspired, I decided to broaden my musical horizons and started learning the chenda DRUM, a traditional percussion instrument from Kerala. This past April, something utterly extraordinary happened—Chitra, along with the famous Malayalam actor Jayaram, came to my city for a musical performance. Her band teamed up with a group of local musicians, and guess what? My drum team was part of the act! There I was, sharing the same stage with my musical idol. In that moment, I turned into a full-on teenage fangirl, screaming, yelling, and bouncing around like I was on a trampoline just like my daughter when she has a euphoric experience seeing Ariana Grande. It was then that I finally understood her outbursts of excitement.
Suddenly, everything about my daughter was a tribute to Ariana—her hairstyle, the way she walked, the way she talked. She even started dressing like her. Her room became a full-blown shrine to Ariana, with her face on the pillowcases, bedsheets, and even the bathroom walls. Now you understand why Ariana Grande has 397 million followers!
This whole experience taught me a lesson that I'll carry with me: before we judge or comment on someone else’s passions, we should take a step back and try to see things from their perspective. Only then can we truly appreciate what lights their fire and understand the depth of their emotions. And, let’s be honest, life’s a lot more fun when you can scream your heart out for what you love—even if you’re doing it alongside your teenage daughter!
