Power BI Dashboard: NHS Digital Mental Health Statistics 2022-23

We are excited to introduce a revamped Power BI dashboard based on the latest NHS Digital Mental Health Statistics for 2022-23. This version improves on the original House of Commons Library Parliament UK report by focusing only on regions, cities, and towns with available data, while excluding areas like Wales and Scotland where no data is present.

The updated dashboard provides a sharper, more focused view of how mental health services are accessed across different regions, making it easier to identify patterns and insights.

Note: You will need the Power BI application to access the report
