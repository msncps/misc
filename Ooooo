🚄 Transformed HS2’s Timeline Data into Dynamic Power BI Visuals!
Excited to share my latest #PowerBI project where I revamped HS2’s timeline data into intuitive, visually appealing dashboards. Key highlights:
• Custom error bars to showcase project progression • Dynamic labels for key milestones and decisions • Interactive timeline spanning 2009-2024 • Dual view approach: Key Developments & Major Events
The visualization leverages Power BI’s advanced features including:
	•	Custom DAX measures for timeline plotting
	•	Error bar visualizations for timeline markers
	•	Dynamic formatting for milestone indicators
	•	Interactive tooltips for detailed information
