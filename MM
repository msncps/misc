Let me tell you a story, Once upon a time, a young man who worked diligently at a factory under the guidance of an old technician. His mentor, a wise and experienced man, taught him three key principles: talk less, do more, and continuously develop your skills. Ten years later, the old man retired, and the young man became a technician himself. He continued to do his work with the same dedication and diligence as he was taught. 
One day, he visited his mentor. The old man saw that he seemed unhappy and asked what was troubling him. The young man said, 'I have been following your instructions exactly all these years. I stay quiet, focus on my work, and have mastered all the skills at the factory. Yet, others with less experience have been promoted, while my pay remains the same.
The old man asked, "Are you sure you’ve become indispensable to the factory?" The young man nodded confidently, "Yes." The old man pondered for a moment, then advised, "Take a day off, using any reason you like. Give yourself a break."
Young man surprised by this advice, but he realized its potential wisdom. He thanked his mentor and quickly vanished. The very next day, he requested a day off. Upon returning to work, he was called into the manager’s office. The manager explained that the factory had struggled in his absence, facing numerous problems that only he could solve. Recognizing his importance, the manager promoted him to senior technician, expressing gratitude for his invaluable contributions.
Grateful for his mentor’s insight, the young man believed he had discovered the secret to success. Whenever he felt undervalued, he would take a day off. When he came back the next day, he is been rewarded. This pattern continued for months. 
However, one day, the young man found suddenly barred from entering the factory. Shocked, he learned that his employment had been abruptly terminated. Devastated & Heartbroken, he sought his mentor to understand where he had gone wrong. "Why did I lose my job?" as I followed your advice exactly."
Old man shook his head and said "You only learned half the lesson. See no one pays any attention to a light bulb that is always on. It is only when it goes off that people suddenly take notice and realize they've been taking it for granted. You were so eager to apply this first lesson, but you missed the second half."
"Second half?" The young man asked, "What was the second half?" The mentor explained, "If a light bulb frequently goes off, it will eventually be replaced with one that is more reliable; Who wants a light bulb which his flickering every time? 
This tale mirrors my journey. I joined Toastmasters many many years ago, I was brimming with confidence, & I always believed public speaking to be easy. A good friend of mine insisted me to join a TM Club, which is a very professional club, as soon I joined the club, the club assigned a seasoned mentor, highly respected in the club. Very soon I got the opportunity to do my Ice Breaker, I was excited & over the moon, I discussed my plans with my mentor’s, she advised, go slow & go easy. I though she underestimates my potential, I ignored her advice I chose a complex topic for my icebreaker speech. The result was a disastrous, and I was absolutely gutted with pathetic performance. I let myself down, I quit Toastmasters & took years to muster the courage to return.
Both stories—the young technician's and mine—revolve around moments where mentorship was partially heeded or ignored. The crucial lesson is that mentorship is not just about listening but about fully understanding and respecting the wisdom imparted.
My message today, shaped by setbacks and growth, is simple: listen wholeheartedly to your mentors. Absorb their wisdom fully and most most important whether it is your TM Journey, or whether it is your professional path or even life choose the right mentors which fits you.
