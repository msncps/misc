My Volkswagen Tiguan has recently reached 9,900 miles on the odometer. When I turn the ignition on, I notice the Oil Level Low warning light illuminating. I'm unsure whether I should simply top up the oil myself or if it's time to take the vehicle in for a full service appointment.

"Could you recommend an affordable, high-quality vacuum cleaner that's effective at removing kitten fur from carpets? Additionally, what's the most suitable trimmer or clipper for grooming my cat's hair?"

What are your suggestions for oil changes, and how often should a complete car service be performed? Should the interval be based on mileage or time?
