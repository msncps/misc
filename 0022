Data to Story: Making Information Matter
Raw data is like scattered LEGO bricks - it needs organization to make sense. First, we sort the pieces by color. Then, we arrange them into patterns. Finally, we transform them into something meaningful, like a LEGO house.
But here’s the key point: just organizing data isn’t enough. Having insights is one thing, but taking action is what really counts.
Think of it as a simple three-step journey:
	•	Sort: Organize the chaos
	•	Arrange: Find the patterns
	•	Present: Build something meaningful
