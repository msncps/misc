My philosophy is: What people say about me is none of my business.
I am who I am and do what I do.
I expect nothing and accept everything.
And that makes life easier.--
We live in a world where funerals are more important than the deceased, marriage is more important than love, looks are more important than the soul.
We live in a packaging culture that despises content."

”8:45 this morning I got Alyssa out of the car and she already saw the state trooper through the window at Dunkin. We went in and the line was all the way back to the door. She ran straight to the officer at the front of the line and hugged him and said "THE POLICE!!!" he said "hi sweetie!" and she said "thank you for protecting us!!". Without a thought he picked her up and bought her a doughnut. The whole store was smiling and let me go to the front of the line to take this picture. He told her if she ever wanted a police car to go down to the station and ask for Danny and she'll get one. Sometimes I get down on myself, but today I felt like Ryder and I were raising our girls right. We teach these girls respect at a young age and times like these are proud moments. So many horrible things go around about the brave men and women who protect us and risk their lives for us. A few bad cops out of MANY do not make them all bad. There are thoughtful and kind law enforcement officers out there and I know a bunch, but this random act of kindness filled my heart. I have no idea who this man is but thank you for making my day and especially my daughter's

WHEN I AM OLD
When I am old...
I will wear soft gray sweatshirts...
and a bandana over my silver hair...
and I will spend my social security checks on my dogs.
I will sit in my house on my well-worn chair
and listen to my dogs breathing.
I will sneak out in the middle of a warm summer night
and take my dogs for a run, if my old bones will allow...
When people come to call, I will smile and nod
as I show them my dogs...
and talk of them and about them...
...the ones so beloved of the past
and the ones so beloved of today...
I will still work hard cleaning after them,
mopping and feeding them and whispering their names
in a soft loving way.
I will wear the gleaming sweat on my throat,
like a jewel, and I will be an embarrassment to all...
especially my family...
who have not yet found the peace in being free
to have dogs as your best friends...
These friends who always wait, at any hour, for your footfall...
and eagerly jump to their feet out of a sound sleep,
to greet you as if you are a God,
with warm eyes full of adoring love and hope
that you will always stay,
I'll hug their big strong necks...
I'll kiss their dear sweet heads...
and whisper in their very special company....
I look in the mirror... and see I am getting old....
this is the kind of person I am...
and have always been.
Loving dogs is easy, they are part of me.
Please accept me for who I am.
My dogs appreciate my presence in their lives...
they love my presence in their lives...
When I am old this will be important to me...
you will understand when you are old,
if you have dogs to love too.

WHO REPORT 

In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common (1). In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Initial estimates show a 26% and 28% increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in just one year (2).

"never judge a book by its cover" or "don't judge a book by its cover" 

We assume we know people’s lives by the mere glimpses they show us. 
Never judge a person unless you’ve walked a mile in their shoes.
Don't judge a person unless you've walked in their shoes. Don't sum a person up by their smiles and laughter
"Never judge a book by its cover: it's impossible to know what's going on in someone's life"

Life is hard enough. Choose kindness.  We don’t know what burdens people are carrying, but we can help them unload that baggage if we assume less and open our minds and heart more. 

We think we know someone based on the brief encounters we exchange, The smiling family photos on Instagram. The superficial exchanges we have over text. The times when we politely ask how someone is doing and they say that they are fine. That isn’t someone’s full life. We shouldn’t judge a person by what they choose to share about their life. It is what they allow you to see. 

Reveal matters that others wouldn’t know by common banter, and give space for others to do the same.  If someone bravely shares something private and difficult to share, express kindness and empathy. Do not turn a blind eye to their pain or tell them what they should or shouldn’t say or feel.  

The answer is, by talking. And it took a lot of talking. Being able to be my true self is so liberating. The fear of being "found out" affects your mental health. The pressure is immense.

I suppose the moral of my story is that anyone can be struck by mental illness. The reason may not be obvious, to the outside world or to the person themselves, straight away. It's impossible to understand what's going on in someone's life and so you should never judge a book by its cover.

I think of mental ill health as carrying two heavy dumbbells. One of them is your actual mental health issue, the way you feel. The other dumbbell is the secrecy, stigma and isolation of keeping it to yourself. If you start to talk to someone and open up about how you feel,  you immediately put down one of those heavy dumbbells. You can then put the energy and time into dealing with the root cause.

If telling my story helps a single person in any way, it's worthwhile! To anyone reading this who is struggling, I'd encourage you to put down one dumbbell... I don't like to think of how my story would have ended if I hadn't.

Feelings are never right or wrong. They simply are what they are. Others may not agree with our feelings, but that does not make our feelings any less valid. Yet feelings are often met with resistance. We are told to suck it up, count our blessings, remember that it could be worse, and sent the underlying message to not speak our truths. Our truths may be different than others, but we are entitled to voice them. Our pain, our truths, our stories- they are all unique and all deserve to be respected and heard.

Take me, for instance. Most people would describe me as peppy, outgoing, bubbly, happy, and exuberant. That is a part of my personality, but there is so much more to me that people don’t know (unless they read my blog, that is).  

In reality, I feel fearful most of the time, I’m quite shy, I have social anxiety, and I am afraid to tell people about my past. I care deeply about others, and I also feel deeply. I put my heart and soul into every post I write, and I grieve for the childhood I never had. Each time I write a post about my past, my vulnerability takes a huge toll on me.  I put my stories out there to try to break the stigma and shame associated with it, and it saddens me that some people I consider friends have not reached out to me about these private and traumatic details. 

I typically show people the side of me that is full of life and contentment; the parts of me that are filled with loneliness and anxiety I tuck away when I am around others. Although talkative and engaging in groups, I am usually exhausted emotionally after a social event. I’m a true introvert, although you’d probably never know it.  

Now, I don’t want you to get the wrong impression. I am not putting on a show when I’m around people. We show different sides to ourselves around different people. I am simply showing one side, and that is a genuine part of who I am. However, there is so much more that doesn’t get seen. There is often much more to someone than meets the eye if you get to really know them and don’t turn away. 

Never judge a person unless you’ve walked a mile in their shoes.

I have gone through hell and back, but I learned at a very young age to keep my pain to myself based on others’ reactions.  Many have gone through their own suffering. They have experienced loss, divorce, miscarriages, bullying, loneliness, depression, and pain.  Most of us keep that part a secret because society has taught us to “tough it out” and “stay strong”.  The people around us feel discomfort about those situations and don’t want to acknowledge them, so those that are struggling often don’t share the full extent of their pain. As a result, it is easy for those of us who are suffering to look around at others and feel inferior. We live in a world where everyone appears to have it all together. I call bullshit.  

I wrote a post about always being grateful, but not feeling grateful this Thanksgiving. Many understood the point I was trying to make and told me how much they appreciated it. It warmed my heart when I was told they felt less alone and more accepted because of my post.  Others commented that we should always be grateful. I was also told that I shouldn’t write about this topic on a public forum out of respect for those that enjoy the holidays and who do feel grateful. 

We shouldn’t judge a person unless we’ve walked a mile in their shoes. 

We must stop assuming, and we must start spreading kindness and empathy.  I write Surviving Mom Blog and use my platform for all those who have suffered and haven’t had the support of others.  Let us accept that we all have our own unique journey. Let us not perpetuate the shame and pain others feel during this time of year or at any time of year.  

Let us start acknowledging the sorrows that exist around us, instead of trying to micromanage those feelings. We must stop ignoring and minimizing what/how others feel.

Don’t judge a person unless you’ve walked in their shoes.

Don’t sum a person up by their smiles and laughter. Instead, talk about topics of sustenance. Reveal matters that others wouldn’t know by common banter, and give space for others to do the same.  If someone bravely shares something private and difficult to share, express kindness and empathy. Do not turn a blind eye to their pain or tell them what they should or shouldn’t say or feel.

Once upon a time there was a King in Scotland named Robert Bruce. They were attacked by England and defected although Bruce was brave and wise. He lost to England for 6 times. After fighting every battle, the Scottish team was left with nothing except running to save their life.

In the end, the Scottish army was scattered, and the King could do nothing but run and hide. He ran and hid in the woods and in the lonely places among the mountains. He was wandering alone in the garden, growing weaker and losing hopes day by day. 

One day, it suddenly started raining heavily. Looking for a shelter, King Bruce found an empty cave. As the King lay on the cold ground thinking to give up, he suddenly saw a spider spinning her web in the cave. The spider was trying hard to spin her thread from one end of the cave to another. But, she kept falling as the thread was short and thin. King Bruce counted that the Spider tried six times to make her thread stick to the wall of the cave, but lost all every time. He felt extremely sad for the spider. 

No alt text provided for this image

But the strong spider did not lose hope even after failing six times. She finally succeeded in the seventh time. This time she tried to spin the thread from the other side of the cave. King Bruce was surprised by this. Watching this tiny creature trying, again and again, gave the King new hope and new strength. He cried and said, “If a little spider can bravely do it without losing hope, then I can also do it.” With this, the King decided to raise his army once more.

When the rain stopped, he came out of the cave and said, “I shall try the seventh time”. 

The rest of the story we all know.

The moral of the story is “Never Give up”

Unquote

Although the spider is a very small creature, it teaches many lessons for success in modern world.

I was working in my Man Cave at the end of the garden when I noticed that a spider had spun its web just outside my window. Hanging as if in mid-air, this little creature was incredibly still, bar the occasional twitch as the wind disturbed the web.

As I was looking for inspiration, I stopped and watched the spider for a bit. I wondered whether this was the same spider that had built the web across our front door some time ago (which we regularly walked through by accident, but was always rebuilt the next day).

OK, it obviously wasn’t the same spider… but a relative maybe?

Spiders are amazing creatures. It takes them an hour to build a web and they build a new one everyday. And then sit there waiting for a twitch. Destroy the web and the spider just starts again. It has to. Without the web, it can’t survive. You can’t just sit around cursing your luck, you have to build another web. The spider also has to be constantly alert, waiting for the slightest tremor that may indicate a snack is available. Get there too late… and no dinner.

Persistence and the power of necessity

I'm like the managing large projects is like being a spider sitting in the middle of a web of stakeholders. You need to be ready to respond to the slightest twitch to keep on track. We’ve all been there.

Why I—like our Scottish friend, whose spider inspired him to defeat the English at Bannockburn—am inspired by the spider is for the very simple power of necessity in promoting action. It’s a no-brainer.

Twenty years ago, I found myself jobless with a mortgage, a toddler and another child on the way, and nothing but a blank sheet of paper to stare at. I had to work out what I was going to do. My web had collapsed and I had mouths to feed.

A little voice was urging me to curl up into a ball and feel sorry for myself.

Not an option.

Keep spinning that web…

“Shake the tree”. Every contact I could think of, people I vaguely knew, people I didn’t know, companies I had googled… anyone I thought I could be useful to heard from me. Almost all of them never responded. But one or two did. And these acorns started me on the path I am still on today.

There was no blinding inspiration or extraordinary idea. It was just the boring stuff. Making lists, sending emails, making calls… spinning away until a new web took shape. And once it’s there, staying alert for twitching.

Have you heard the story of the Chinese bamboo tree? It's a classic tale of perseverance, determination, and the importance of never giving up (even when it feels like you're getting nowhere).

The story goes like this: 

A farmer plants a small bamboo seed and waters it faithfully every day. For four long, excruciating years, the seed doesn't sprout. There's no sign of life, no visible progress. The farmer might be tempted to throw in the towel and assume the seed is a dud, but instead, he persists and continues to water the seed every day.

And then, in the fifth year, something miraculous happens. The bamboo tree suddenly grows 80 feet tall in just six weeks.

Here’s the thing: 

The Chinese bamboo tree's impressive growth spurt wasn't due to some kind of magic or divine intervention. It was simply the result of the farmer's consistent effort and patience. Those four years of watering and waiting were crucial for the seed to develop its root system and become strong enough to grow.

While apparently true (but not yet verified by me personally!) this story very much describes the way I try to continue building and growing our business - plant seeds today that could grow into something very meaningful many years down the road. The story is also very applicable to ways you can think about other areas of life and investing.

Takeaway: 

Just keep going. It might take a while, but with hard work, resilience, and persistence…success just might be right around the corner.

We all need to be reminded that outward progress doesn’t necessarily reflect or measure inward progress. Zig Ziglar tells the story of the Chinese Bamboo Tree.

“When this particular seed of the Chinese Bamboo tree is planted, watered, and nurtured, for years it doesn’t outwardly grow as much as an inch. Nothing happens for the first year. There’s no sign of growth. Not even a hint. The same thing happens – or doesn’t happen – in the second year. And then the third year. The tree is carefully watered and fertilized each year, but nothing shows. No growth. No anything. So it goes as the sun rises and sets for four solid years. The farmer and his wife have nothing tangible to show for this labor or effort. Then, along comes year five. After five years of fertilizing and watering have passed, with nothing to show for it – the bamboo tree suddenly sprouts and grows eighty feet in just SIX WEEKS!

Did the little tree lie dormant for four years only to grow exponentially in the fifth? Or, was the little tree growing underground, developing a root system strong enough to support its potential for outward growth in the fifth year and beyond? The answer is, of course, obvious. Had the tree not developed a strong unseen foundation it could not have sustained its life as it grew.”

Your dreams, no matter how big, are not in vain. Just because you don’t see signs of progress now, do not grow weary in continuing to build, to give it everything you have heart and soul. Even though overly critical friends remind you of how much easier it would be to give up, be more realistic, more practical, or find a new passion…

choose to believe that growth is happening underground. A root system is being formed within your life, the kind of roots will outlast storms because of the hard work and commitment it’s taken to stand in faith for something it cannot easily prove or qualify.

As we go in our dreams (e.g. personal, professional, business, etc.) let us continue to nurture and develop our roots and foundations as every step or minute of effort makes a difference and every step you take makes an impact. You may not see the change right away, but growth is happening. With commitment and drive to attain our goals, and with God’s help we can surely reach our dreams.🫶

Recently, I had the pleasure of having dinner with a few lawyer and non-lawyer friends in London. As conversations go after a few tipples of wine and late night feasting in such “learned gatherings”, we somehow began talking about coping with the stresses of work and about finding time to keep abreast of developments and about social media.

To my amazement, the room soon became divided. One group furiously arguing that they would not succumb to what they saw as “technology fads” (a few did not even have social media accounts they used for work) and “time wasting”. The other group feverishly arguing about how it was impossible to survive professionally without connections and conversations with the outside world. No prizes for guessing which camp I was in.

As I sat there defending why I make it a point to dedicate a few hours of my day on LinkedIn and Twitter (not just to share, but also to read and learn from others), I remembered the well-known Chinese parable about the frog in the well. There are several versions of the story, but the one I like best (courtesy of wikibooks) is as follows:


The frog lived down in a well where there was all he had to live. One day, a soft-shelled turtle came by and told him about the sea. 'The sea? Hah! It's paradise in here. Nothing can be better than this well. Why don't you come down and share my joy?'

The turtle tried, and failed as the mouth of the well was too small. 'Why don't you go see the sea instead? During Yu the Great's reign, there was flooding for nine out of ten years, yet the sea barely grew an inch. During Tang of Shang's reign, droughts were experienced in seven out of eight years, yet the sea hardly shrank. Being unaffected by such disasters is the joy of living in the sea.'

So what is the moral of all this and how does it connect to my memorable dinner party?

The parable and the proverb “living like a frog in the well” has become a poignant reminder alerting people not to hide inside their comfort zones and to embrace and make it a point to catch up with the way the world moves. Living in one’s cosy well will mean that one can only see from the perspective of a small hole from above. Metaphorically speaking, it portrays a person with no ambitions and is unfortunately satisfied with the life they are living inside the well.

Social media, I argue (as I did then at dinner), has shown me countless open doors and windows of opportunities to grow professionally and I don’t see myself jumping into a well anytime soon.

I just hope I get invited for dinner again ! And oh yes, no frogs were harmed in the production of this post.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As narrated by Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of World Religion in the year 1983!
A frog lived in a well. It had lived there for a long time. It was born there and brought up there, and yet was a little, small frog. Every day it cleansed the water of all the worms and bacilli that lived in it with an energy that would do credit to our modern bacteriologists. In this way it went on and became a little sleek and fat. Well, one day another frog that lived in the sea came and fell into the well.
“Where are you from?”
“I am from the sea.”
“The sea! How big is that? Is it as big as my well?” and he took a leap from one side of the well to the other.
“My friend,” said the frog of the sea, “how do you compare the sea with your little well?”
Then the frog took another leap and asked, “Is your sea so big?”
“What nonsense you speak, to compare the sea with your well!”
“Well, then,” said the frog of the well, “nothing can be bigger than my well; there can be nothing bigger than this; this fellow is a liar, so turn him out.”
Now there are two perspectives to this story. And both of them are relatable and equally hold good.
The frog in the well, neither has complaint about its 'small' well. It lives happily with everything that little well has to offer.
The frog is also unaware of the existence of relatively bigger and better ocean outside the well. Neither it wants to learn about it, nor it want to accept it.
Just like this frog in the well, all of us are pushed to 2 kinds of situations in our daily life.
Living all by ourselves in our own world
Living with others in their worlds.
While it is important to focus on all the good things you have in your own inner world, and be happy about it, it is also vital to align yourself to the bigger world that lies outside.
Staying in is comfortable but going out is more pleasurable and enjoyable.
Enjoying your own company is important, but building connections with others is also essential.
Appreciate all great things you possess but also be aware of what you lack.
Brace yourself for all the things you did right but also be open to criticism and suggestions for all the things you have been doing wrong.
Be proud about yourself, but also learn to respect others.
Stand up for yourself, your family, your community, your nation, your beliefs and practices, but also be empathetic to others'.
Stick to your convictions but also be open to new ideas.
Savor the good moments but also be mindful of the risky situations and be equipped for the same.
Seek privacy. But do not get locked up.
Let go of the past but remember the lesson learnt.
Embrace the solitude but eliminate the social isolation.
Immerse yourself in your own world, thoughts and imaginations but do not be insensitive to the surroundings or outside world.
Build the walls to protect yourself but break the barriers that stopping you to progress.
Be individual contributor but also develop the team spirit to achieve the common & shared goals.
Build your own knowledge-base and expertise, and perfect it by sharing with others.
Present your ideas with confidence, but also be open to considering other perspectives.
Be confident in your capabilities but also be aware of the competitions.
Utilize your talents to the fullest but also be ready to upgrade yourself to the new skills.
Work with the intrepidity of a lion but at the same time act with the tenderness of a flower.
So, don't be a Frog in the Well! Let us get into the "Ocean" of Joy and Prosperity!

It’s mid-morning already, so…how many frogs have you eaten so far?
I’m sure you know what I’m getting at here?
“Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day”.
It’s been said a million times or more since Mark Twain (allegedly) first said it years ago.
You’ve heard it. I’ve heard it.
So why do we all still ignore it?
I mean it’s great advice.
We all know we should get the grotty, unpleasant things off the to-do list quickly…that tackling the most daunting tasks early on builds momentum that runs through the day…that the tough stuff is best handled when the mind is sharp and focused, leaving the simpler things for the natural energy dips that come mid-afternoon…
We all know this. But do we follow the rule?
Well, let’s be honest…most people don’t.
I don’t know if this includes you, or your staff, but there’s no denying…those who follow the norm will do anything but munch a bit of frog!
They’ll stagger to their desks first thing, still yawning and clutching a Costa. They’ll spend 20 minutes on Facebook or chatting with co-workers about last night’s ‘Corrie’. And when they finally break a sweat, the frogs get pushed aside.
Because it’s easier to take on a fun or simple task and convince yourself that you’re doing something important.
There’s no big revelation here, I know. But if you’re still getting frog-like tasks showing up in your email calendar…and if you’re ignoring them, day after day…well, it’s a point worth making.
Because…Frog-Munching is the one thing that can set your business apart.
While your competitors opt for the easy life…or just lick the odd frog for a moment then put it aside until never…you’re doing the hard things that bring in the rewards.
You’re holding difficult conversations. Tackling confrontation. Crunching numbers until your brain melts.
They’re not fun, these froggy tasks. But they pay dividends.
And as Twain said, when you do this stuff early, you’re in control of the day. Like getting a head start in a race, you suddenly feel you can’t lose.
So if I had my way, this is guidance everyone would take: start the day with a list of 3 or 4 tasks and bite down hard on the nasty one first. That’s a no-brainer for me.
But it’s also worth saying, this principle is about more than how you manage your day. It’s also a great rule for life…if you think about it.
“First thing in the morning” means now – today. And “the rest of the day” is the rest of your life.
So the more you’re willing to tackle now, the more you’ll thank yourself in the future.
To you, that might mean showing up at the gym…or studying long into the night…or sacrificing time off, so you can build a better business.
Or it could mean going through tough experiences, to give you the steel and resolve for any challenge that follows.
Case in point: a friend of mine did some stand-up comedy when he was 19. He was way out of his depth (so he tells me) and the audience was unforgiving. He got endless verbal abuse, up there alone on stage, but he saw it through to the bitter end.
That was years ago. And since then, he’s never been afraid of speaking in public. He reasons, he’s already had the worst possible experience…so it’s all good from here on in.
He ate the frog, and it paid off.
So, here’s my challenge for you this week…
EITHER:
1 – Get ruthless with your to-do list. Every day, choose a handful of achievable…and worthwhile…tasks and start with the one you’re dreading. Take it as far as you can for the day before you move on to the next one.
OR:
2 – Face up to a bigger fear, like calling prospects or writing sales copy. If you fail, there’s nothing to fear again…you’ve already seen the worst of it. And if you succeed, well…it wasn’t as hard as you thought it would be!
Eat the frog.
…Then either way, you can’t lose.

 So here's my story. I used to put things off, which was my sexy way of saying procrastination! I had to learn to get things done and to stop procrastinating. I had to put systems in place that helped me to be more effective and efficient. So today, I want to share with you one technique that helped me.
Well......I am not alone; we all procrastinate! Procrastination occurs when we avoid tasks that we find unpleasant. Even if we perform other related tasks instead of the ones we dislike, we are still guilty of procrastination. Unfortunately, procrastination can be a hindrance to our long-term success. The good news is that you can overcome procrastination and get things done with the proper skills!
Mark Twain has a saying that applies to procrastination: if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that will happen to you all day long! I personally don’t like frogs, but if I had to eat one, I want it well done! (lol, smile).
Because of this saying, Brian Tracy named his course on time management “Eat that Frog.” The frog is anything that you do not want to do. You should complete your dreaded🤦🏽♀️ tasks first. Getting them out of the way will give you a sense of accomplishment and keep you from procrastinating. Always begin with the task that is the hardest and most significant, and you will be less tempted to procrastinate on other activities.
When you dislike a particular task, it is easy to procrastinate. Whether you spend time checking email or looking at Instagram/Facebook, you are procrastinating. It would help if you did more than identify when you procrastinate. You need to discover why! Discover your obstacles: What do you choose over your essential tasks? Discover ways to remove the barriers: Ask for support, and take action. For example, you could turn off the Internet, TV, and your phone. You could also reward yourself by making the task fun and using small rewards as an incentive.
Once you have identified your frogs and obstacles, the only answer is to take action! Make the tasks that you want to avoid part of your daily routine. Schedule the tasks into your calendar. Once they become a habit, you will find them easier to accomplish. Once you have scheduled the time to accomplish your tasks, you must follow through. Resist the temptation to procrastinate with your favorite time-waster. Just do it!
You must eat the frog, and if you are like me, then you want it well done! Simply put, you want the task accomplished!!!!!!💯
I can hear someone saying 🗣 but there is just not enough time in the day. Well, lack of time is a common excuse for not completing a task. However, we all get the same 24-hours but how we manage it makes all the difference. We often overestimate the time it takes to complete tasks, but the 15-minute rule allows you to time your tasks accurately.
When you follow the 15-minute rule, you set a timer ⏰ for 15 minutes and work on a task. It would be best to stop working on the task when the time is up. You will be surprised by how many tasks you complete within 15 minutes; when you cannot complete a task within 15 minutes, schedule 15 minutes the next day for the same task. This allows you to make consistent progress. You will also be able to estimate better how long a similar task will take. So get started today and apply the 15-minute rule and eat that frog! Just do it! You got this!

A booing crowd at Wimbledon tried to knock Novak off his game.

They messed with the wrong guy. His great rebuttal for any pro:

This week at Wimbledon, the typically polite English crowd was rooting for opponent Holger Rune.

They were using his last name “Rune” to extend into “boos” to root against Novak.

The crowd used chants of “Ruuuuuuune” to be boos against Novak during the match.

“Boos” are typically shut down at Wimbledon by a chair umpire but this was a grey area and the umpire let it happen.

Novak didn’t flinch.
I had already flunked high schooH

He went on to win.

No athlete has been more transparent about the mental strength required of a true professional than Novak Djokovic.

Once a source of weakness, Novak has trained specifically on the mental side of his game. It unlocked his success on the court.

From a previous interview:

“One of the biggest things I’ve learned about mental strength:
Recovery of how long you stay in that emotion is what differentiates you from others.”

Novak prepares his mind for far more hostile environments than the boos this week at Wimbledon.

It’s no surprise that those sitting in the stands trying to get in his way had zero impact.

“I’ve played in much more hostile environments. You guys can’t touch me.”

The professional is always ready.

Masterpieces in Making" – where each of us is crafting our unique journey to greatness. Watch as we paint our paths with words, creativity, and a lot of fun! 

You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply."

All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food?

And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them?

You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health. But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --

are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal. Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.


Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: “I came to realize...”


"I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills. It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"


Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don’t like. I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. But I still have a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.


Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap.


There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention.

 actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody.


We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before. We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.


So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations.


Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.


Number two: Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog.

Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again, assume that you have something to learn.


Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't." I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.


Number three: Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't." "Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry." Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like, "What was that like?" "How did that feel?" Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response.

Number four: Go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered. That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.

And we stop listening. Stories and ideas are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go.


Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know. Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap.

Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs. If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly, it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."

Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.

Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. Don't do that.

Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care. What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out.

Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning." And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."

Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk. When I'm talking, I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place.

You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply."

One more rule, number 10, and it’s this one: Be brief. Be interested in other people.

You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she’d say, “Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer." And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can. I keep my mind open. And I’m always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed.


You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.

I actually misspoke and said 225 words per minute. That's an oft-cited number for the average number of words per minute that an American adult speaks. After digging into the subject further, it turns out that number is probably low. Speaking rate varies widely, but the real number is probably between 150 words per minute and 180 words per minute.

When I was a kid, the violin was the center of my life. I'd run home from the bus stop after school and practice for hours. Every Saturday, my mom and I would wake up at four in the morning to catch a train to New York so I could study at Juliard. Here's a throwback to eight-year-old me performing the violin. Some questionable fashion choices from young Maya here, not going to lie.


But anyway, when I was a teenager, my musical idol, Itzhak Perlman, invited me to be his private student. And my big dream of becoming a concert violinist felt within reach. But then one morning when I was 15, I was practicing this tricky technical passage. I struggled to get it right, and I overextended my finger on a single note. I heard a popping sound. I’d permanently damaged the tendons in my hand, and my dream was over.

I share this story because unexpected change happens to all of us. An accident or an illness, a relationship that suddenly ends.

Today, I'm not a violinist, but I'm a cognitive scientist. And I'm interested in how we respond to exactly this kind of change. I spent the past two decades studying the science of human behavior. And today I host a podcast called "A Slight Change of Plans" --

glad you guys like it -- where I interview people from all over the world about their life-altering experiences.

I started this podcast because change is scary for a lot of us, am I right? For one, it is filled with uncertainty, and we hate uncertainty. Research shows that we're more stressed when we're told we have a 50 percent chance of getting an electric shock than when we're told we have a 100 percent chance. It's wild, right? I mean, we'd rather be sure that a bad thing is going to happen than to have to deal with any uncertainty. Change is also scary because it involves loss of some kind. By definition, we're departing from an old way of being and entering a new one. And when we experience a change that we wouldn't have chosen for ourselves, it's easy to feel that our lives are contracting, that were more limited than before.

But when we take this perspective, we fail to account for an important fact. That when an unexpected change happens to us, it can also inspire lasting change within us. We become different people on the other side of change. What we're capable of, what we value and how we define ourselves, these things can all shift. And if we can learn to pay close attention to these internal shifts, we may just find that rather than limiting us, change can actually expand us.

Alright, today I'm going to share with you three questions you can ask yourself the next time life throws you that dreaded curveball. In the moment, I know it's so easy to focus on what you've lost. And so I'm really hoping that you can use these questions as tools to discover all that you might gain.

Alright, let’s start with question number one. This is inspired by a conversation I had on my podcast with a woman named Christine Ha, and it's about our capabilities. Christine was 24 when a rare autoimmune disease left her permanently blind. At the time, she was learning to cook the Vietnamese dishes that she had loved in childhood. But now cooking even simple meals was tough. She told me that her frustration peaked one day when she was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She struggled to align the two slices of bread and sticky jelly dripped all over her hands and onto the counter. She threw the sandwich into the trash, and she felt really defeated by the limited future that she imagined for herself. Since Christine lived alone though, she had no choice but to keep at it. She remembers her delight when she successfully cut an orange for the first time and when she scrambled an egg without burning it. As she spent more hours in the kitchen, she realized that cooking was far more multi-sensory than she had thought. While she couldn't see if the garlic had browned, she could rely on the smell and the sizzling sounds in the pan. But Christine also realized something bigger. Something new was emerging within her.

At the start of her vision loss she had cooked just to get by. I mean, it was really just a practical thing. But now she was thrilled by the challenge of it all. She tackled harder and harder recipes over the years and eventually became the first-ever blind contestant on the TV show "Master Chef." And guess what? She won the entire damn thing.

Christine's a rock star. She's an amazing, amazing person. This brings us to the first question that you can ask yourself the next time you face something unexpected. "How might this change change what you're capable of?" When we predict how we'll respond to any given change, we tend to imagine what our present-day selves will be like in that new situation. Research by the psychologist Dan Gilbert shows that we greatly underestimate how much we'll change in the future, even though we fully acknowledge we've changed considerably in the past. Our psychology continually tricks us into believing that who we are, right now, in this very moment, is the person that's here to stay. But the person meeting the challenges after an unexpected change will be different. You will be different. Today, Christine is a world-renowned chef. She goes by the nickname The Blind Cook, and she owns three restaurants in Texas. And importantly, she's really curious about what else she can achieve without vision. These days, you can find her snowboarding and rock climbing on the weekends.

Christine shared with me something that she could never have imagined thinking before all this. That if given the choice today, she would choose not to have her vision restored. Though she did tell me she'd like it back for a moment because she really wants to know what Justin Bieber looks like.

Alright, let's move on to the second question. This one is about our values, and it's inspired by a conversation I had with a science journalist named Florence Williams. One evening about five years ago, Florence and her husband were hosting a dinner party for their friends. As she was preparing the salad, her husband handed her his phone so that she could read an email from a relative. But he'd mistakenly pulled up the wrong email. What Florence saw instead was a lengthy note from her husband, confessing his love to another woman. I know. Florence’s 25-year marriage came to an end, and she told me that she was taken aback by the physical and emotional intensity of her heartbreak. She said it felt like she'd been plugged into a faulty electrical socket. Since Florence is a problem solver by nature, she instinctively saw her heartbreak as a problem to solve and develop a year-long, systematic plan to try and fix it. Florence tried a bunch of things. She took solo trips into the wilderness, she tried a range of experimental therapies, She even went to the Museum of Broken Relationships, which I promise is the thing. You name it, she tried it. But by the end of the year, none of these remedies had healed her broken heart. And so Florence had no choice but to entertain a new philosophy altogether. Maybe a broken heart was not a problem to solve. And maybe closure wasn't the answer. Research by the psychologist Dacher Keltner shows that when we reduce our need for what's called cognitive closure, the desire to arrive at clear and definitive answers, our capacity to feel joy and beauty expands. Florence told me that when she freed herself from this goal-oriented mindset, a mindset, by the way, that she had valued for so much of her life up until this point, she began to find unexpected delight in the unknown.

This leads us to the second question you can ask yourself the next time you face something unexpected. How might this change change what you value? The unexpected implosion of Florence's marriage has permanently shifted the way that she sees her life. From a puzzle in need of solutions to a more serendipitous path of discovery.

Now, when Florence goes hiking, she's just as likely to sit still, feeling the breeze, as she is to try and make the summit. She no longer makes five-year plans. And she's comfortable not knowing all the answers around her heartbreak. By the way, I was texting with Florence the other day, and she's currently in a very happy relationship. If her ex-husband is listening to this, I just want him to know she's doing great, buddy.

Alright, now on to question number three. This one is about how we define ourselves. It's about our self-identities. And it comes from my personal story of change with the violin. When my injury took the violin away from me, I found myself grieving not just the loss of the instrument, but also the loss of myself. For so long, the violin had defined me, that without it, I wasn't sure who I was or who I could be. I felt stuck. I'd later learned that this phenomenon is known as identity paralysis. It happens to a lot of us when we face the unexpected. Who we think we are and what we're about is suddenly called into question. But I since realized that there was something different, something more stable that I could have anchored my identity to.

And this brings us to that third and final question. How might this change change how you define yourself? When I re-examine my relationship with the violin, I discovered that what I really missed wasn't the instrument itself, but the fact that music had given me a vehicle for connecting emotionally with others. I remember as a little kid playing for people and feeling kind of awestruck that we might all feel something new together. What this means for me today is that I no longer anchor my identity to specific pursuits like being a violinist or a cognitive scientist or a podcaster. Instead, I anchor my identity to what lights me up about those pursuits, what really energizes me. And for me, it's a love of human connection and understanding. I now define myself not by what I do, but why I do it.

Look, unexpected change comes for us all, whether we like it or not. And when it does, it can really suck. But I'm hoping that if we can stay open to how we might internally change, how we might expand, it can help us weather the storm. Life recently threw me a new slight change of plans. I've always wanted to be a mom, but becoming one has been difficult and my husband and I have had to navigate pregnancy losses and other heartbreaks over the years. And now I'm not sure what will happen. But I'm using these three questions to help me during this tough time. I'm asking myself how this unexpected challenge might change what I'm capable of, what I value, and how I define myself. I'm still figuring things out.

But what I can tell you right now is that I'm imagining a future me who is expanding her definition of what it means to parent. Who's perhaps finding what she craved from motherhood in other places. At a minimum, this exploration has allowed me to loosen my grip on the identity of Mom just a bit. And I found it freeing. I'm beginning to see change with more possibility. And I'm hoping you can, too.

Each one is a part of any success that you might achieve in the future.

You can't hope to attract a set of values that you yourself aren't embracing.

Everything is a reflection of one's thoughts.

We are what we see.

(I.e. a cynical or an apprehensive person will always be critical or suspicious of others, while a good person will inevitably identify/see the good in others)

So the best way to improve one's life experiences is to be a good person and our mind will start seeing the good in everyone and it becomes a self fulfilling loop I.e. if you act nice throughout others are bound to reciprocate eventually inevitably.

Watch Lionel Messi’s countrymen as he emerges before a game.

From this week’s Copa America - what earned status looks like:

This month’s Copa America is a rare moment to watch the best in the world play for their country.

Messi has led his team to this weekend’s final. The way they take the field is fascinating.

As the Argentina national team gets ready to take the pitch before a game, they wait for their leader, Messi, to show up.

He takes his position in the center and in the front.

They fall in line and in pace, saying nothing.

They follow his lead.

Every single one of these players was the leader of their own childhood team, the star player of their city.

Each one has grown up as an Alpha among Alphas.

But they all follow in behind this man.

Why do they do that?

Because he has earned their respect with his own hard work, his transcendent skill and his own accomplishments.

After all he has done in his career, he is humble, quiet, focused.

Messi doesn’t say a single word and 11 Alpha males fall in line with him.

This is what “earned status” looks like at the highest levels of any domain.

Takeaway
Leadership doesn’t need to be loud.

Become great at your craft. Put in the work. Be quiet and humble.

The most powerful status is earned that way.

Mental strength isn't a gift.

It can and should be trained.

Novak Djokovic, said it best:
"You have your doubts and fears. I don’t like this mindset in sports of 'just think positive thoughts, be optimistic.' It’s impossible. You are a human being."

"The ability to reset and move on is the key.”

This applies not only to Djokovic on the tennis court but to all of us

One of my strongest beliefs:

Happiness is a natural byproduct of progress.

You derive more joy from the “a-ha!” moments of learning and growth than any outcome or prize will ever provide.

Mini life hack: If you’re ever feeling stuck in a rut, look back at yourself 6 months ago.

You’ll generally cringe at where you were.

It’s a nice reminder of progress, even when you can’t feel it in the moment.

This is also the reason I think lifelong learners tend to be the happiest people.

They constantly embrace their own ignorance and experience those "a-ha" moments along the way.

The next point

Like many people, I loved Roger Federer’s recent commencement speech, and there is a part that stood out to me as especially relevant to anyone building a startup (or investing in startups).

“What % of points do you think I won in those matches? Only 54%.”

“When you lose every second point, on average, you learn not to dwell on every shot.”

And these are the stats for one of the greatest players of all time, remember that. The great Roger Federer only won 54% of his points. 

One of the hardest things about working in startups is that there is a lot of noise, and that you usually only hear or read about the successes. This can be paralyzing. 

Also, the more successful you become, the more opportunities you get to see. 

Many of the best investors and builders I know have had the chance to take part in some of the biggest companies out there. And by definition they have missed out on almost all of them. In fact, the more successful you are, the more you have missed out, because you have usually had access to so much. There is an abundance of opportunity out there and you will only catch a tiny fraction of the fish. 

That's enough to drive anyone crazy. 

But remember that it's never you vs the big wide world. The world is just a collection of individuals just like yourself. It's you and a whole bunch of other people living their unique stories. 

Never dwell on the past. Only learn from it, and then move on. 

And startups have a big advantage compared to tennis… Startups are a game of extreme power law. 

You only need one to really hit.

A truth I wish I had learned earlier:

When you avoid a difficult conversation, you’re taking on a debt that has to be repaid (with interest) at a date in the future.

Your success in life is proportional to the number of difficult conversations you’re willing to have.

The student again nodded, yes.

The Buddha then explained, "In life, we cannot always control the first arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. The second arrow is optional."

The first arrow is the negative event that hits our lives.

This is the uncontrollable chaos that we may find ourselves thrown into from time to time.

The first arrow is impossible to avoid. It hits and it hurts.

The second arrow is governed by our response to the first—and as the parable teaches us, being struck by the second arrow is entirely within our control.

Our power is in the space that we can create between stimulus and response.

Creating that space is the key to avoiding the second arrow.

As Frankl famously said, “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

So the next time you encounter an uncontrollable negative event in your life—when you're struck by that painful first arrow—consider the parable of the two arrows.

The first arrow may have hurt, but the second arrow is always optional.

Our reaction and response controls the direction and force of the second arrow:

• If we attach ourselves to the pain of the first arrow, continue to think all of the negative thoughts it brought about, repeat the patterns of our past, dwell in the pain, and bemoan our bad luck, we send the second arrow hurtling straight into our open wound.

• If we pause, breathe, give ourselves a moment to reset, and choose a balanced response, we send the second arrow falling feebly to the ground.

One of my strongest beliefs:

Happiness is a natural byproduct of progress.

You derive more joy from the “a-ha!” moments of learning and growth than any outcome or prize will ever provide.

Mini life hack: If you’re ever feeling stuck in a rut, look back at yourself 6 months ago.

You’ll generally cringe at where you were.

It’s a nice reminder of progress, even when you can’t feel it in the moment.

This is also the reason I think lifelong learners tend to be the happiest people.

They constantly embrace their own ignorance and experience those "a-ha" moments along the way.

“The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.” — Albert Einstein

This is a simple, beautiful proverb on the power of acts of service:

If you want happiness for an hour—take a nap.

If you want happiness for a day—go fishing.

If you want happiness for a year—inherit a fortune.

If you want happiness for a lifetime—help someone else.

Acting in service of others is the path to lasting fulfillment in life.

Those who recognize this play the game on another level.

Create value, receive value.

A university professor posed a challenge to his students. Each of them had a balloon with their name. The balloons would fall from the ceiling and they would have 5 minutes to find theirs. If everyone found the one with their name, they won... if not, they lost. 

Although they tried with all their energy to find them, no one succeeded. The teacher put the balloons back and told them, "When you catch a balloon, give it to its owner". The test took less than 3 minutes to complete. 

The teacher finished by saying, "Happiness is like these balloons. If each of us looks only for our own, we will never find it. But if we look for others', we will also find ours." Exactly the same happens with teamwork in companies. If you help others achieve their goals, others will do the same with you. 

Happiness is like these balloons... a lesson in life and leadership.

There was a village where a competition was held yearly to decide the person whose crop was the best.

Then news spread that since last many years, the winner was the same old farmer. That intrigued a news reporter and so he went to interview this farmer.

During the interview, the news reporter was further intrigued. That farmer said that each year, he distributed his high-quality seeds with everyone in the village.
“Wouldn’t that drastically reduce your chances of winning the yearly competition?”, the reporter asked.

To which the farmer replied, “If the seeds in the neighborhood are of low quality, then cross-pollination would spoil the crops of the entire village including my own. Having good crops in my neighborhood is only beneficial for all of us!”

I can’t give much back to people who helped me meet the club requirements. Neither can you possibly return the favor to those who helped you.

But, here’s what we can do:

In a world where selflessness is often undervalued, we can remember the lesson of the BEST CROP and strive to cultivate a culture of generosity and solidarity.

That will guarantee a harvest of goodwill that will enrich us all.

Imagine a creature with a hundred legs, each moving in perfect harmony. This creature is the centipede, a marvel of nature that demonstrates an extraordinary level of coordination and teamwork. Now, let's think about our own teams. Can we say we move as seamlessly as a centipede? Today, I want to explore how the centipede can teach us about the power of effective teamwork.

Middle:
Consider the centipede’s movements. With so many legs, you might expect chaos, yet it moves with surprising grace. This is because each leg knows its role and works in sync with the others. In a team, every member, like a leg of the centipede, has a specific role and responsibility. When each member understands their role and works towards a common goal, the team moves smoothly and efficiently.

Let me share a story to illustrate this point. In a small village, there was a team of builders tasked with constructing a bridge. Each member had a unique skill: one was an architect, another a carpenter, another a mason, and so on. Initially, they worked independently, leading to miscommunication and delays. However, after observing a centipede and discussing its coordination, they decided to assign clear roles and communicate more effectively. The architect designed, the carpenter built the framework, and the mason laid the stones, each knowing their part in the bigger picture. Soon, the bridge was completed ahead of schedule and stood as a testament to their teamwork.

Ending:
The centipede teaches us that effective teamwork requires coordination, communication, and a clear understanding of roles. Just as the centipede's legs move in harmony to achieve its movement, so must we align our efforts to achieve our goals. By working together, knowing our roles, and supporting each other, we can move with the grace and efficiency of a centipede, overcoming obstacles and reaching new heights. So, let’s take a lesson from the centipede and commit to being better team members, working together to achieve greatness.

Opening:
Imagine standing in a garden on a sunny day, surrounded by the gentle hum of bees. These tiny insects, often overlooked, are a powerful example of teamwork in nature. As they buzz from flower to flower, they are not just collecting nectar; they are demonstrating the extraordinary power of working together towards a common goal. Today, let's explore how the bees can teach us about the essence of effective teamwork.

Middle:
Bees operate within a highly structured and efficient system. Each bee has a specific role: workers gather nectar, drones mate with the queen, and the queen lays eggs. Despite their different roles, each bee understands its part in maintaining the hive’s health and productivity. This clear division of labor and mutual support system ensures the survival and prosperity of the colony.

Consider the story of a struggling startup. Initially, the team members were all doing a bit of everything, leading to confusion and inefficiency. They decided to adopt a new approach after a visit to a local apiary, where they observed the bees' harmonious operation. Inspired, they defined clear roles: one member focused on marketing, another on product development, and another on customer support. With each person knowing their role and how it contributed to the bigger picture, the team began to work more cohesively. Just like bees in a hive, their productivity soared, and the startup flourished.

Ending:
The bees teach us that successful teamwork requires clear roles, mutual respect, and effective communication. Each bee, no matter how small, contributes to the hive’s success. Similarly, in our teams, each member’s contribution is vital. By working together, understanding our roles, and supporting one another, we can create a symphony of productivity and success. So, let’s take a lesson from the bees and commit to fostering a collaborative and efficient team environment, where everyone’s efforts contribute to our collective achievements. Together, like the bees, we can achieve greatness.
