Hi Jake,

Following up on our discussion last Monday, have you been able to get the IDs? I’d like to investigate whether the new setup codes have been ingested into Power BI. The discrepancies we’re seeing might be related to these new codes or changes in the business logic.

From a quick review, it seems the business logic and a new table have been introduced in the report, which has altered the back-end data model.

Could you please share the new codes with me? This will allow me to perform an initial analysis to pinpoint what went wrong with the report data. From there, we can determine the next steps.

Thanks,
