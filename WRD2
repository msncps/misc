How well do you know your Figures of Speech?

The appropriate use of figure of speech can enrich your speeches and create the expected responses from your audience.

❓ What is a Figure of Speech?

↔ It is a technique or type of language that is used by a speaker for the purpose of evoking a particular reaction from the listener or persuading them to think in a certain way. 

↔ It employs sentence structures, sounds, or patterns of meaning to evoke a particular reaction. 

↔ Each Figure of speech can be used to construct an argument or make an existing argument more compelling.
 
Example – Hyperbole.
 
Hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration that adds emphasis, urgency, or excitement to a statement.
 
Examples of Hyperbole - 

✅ If I don’t eat soon, I’m going to die of hunger.
✅ I have done this a thousand times.
✅ I am so hungry I could eat a horse.
✅ I was dying of laughter.
✅ I will be there in two seconds.
✅ I haven't seen you in ages!
 
In our Figure of Speech Series, we will be exploring some important types of figures of speech and how to use them in your speeches to invoke the right response.

Speaking Voice and Writing Voice

When evaluating a speech, it's essential to consider both the speaking voice and the writing voice. These two aspects, though distinct, are deeply interconnected in effective speech delivery.

1. Speaking Voice:

The speaking voice is the audible expression of your thoughts and emotions. It's not just about what you say, but how you say it. Your tone, pace, pitch, and inflection all contribute to how your message is received. An effective speaking voice is like a skilled musician playing an instrument. Just as a musician uses variations in tempo, volume, and melody to convey different emotions and stories, a speaker uses their voice to bring depth and nuance to their message.

Consider the difference between a flat, monotonous voice and one that varies in pitch and pace. The former is like a steady drumbeat, predictable and unengaging, while the latter is like a symphony, with highs and lows that captivate the audience. A dynamic speaking voice can emphasize key points, create mood, and keep the audience engaged.

2. Writing Voice:

The writing voice, on the other hand, is the unique way you express yourself in words. It's your style, your choice of words, and the structure of your sentences. This is where your personality shines through. Just as a painter uses different brushes and colors to create a mood or scene, a writer uses words and sentence structures to paint a picture in the listener's mind.

Your writing voice should be clear, concise, and tailored to your audience. It's about choosing the right words to convey your message effectively and engagingly. For example, a speech filled with jargon and complex language might be like an abstract painting, difficult for many to interpret, while a speech with simple, vivid language is like a realistic landscape, easily understood and appreciated.

Combining the Two:

The art of speech-making lies in harmonizing these two voices. Imagine a chef creating a dish. The writing voice is like the ingredients – each word and phrase carefully chosen for flavor and impact. The speaking voice is the cooking technique – how these ingredients are brought to life with heat and skill. Both are essential, and when combined effectively, they create a memorable experience for the audience.

When evaluating a speech, pay attention to how well the speaker blends their writing and speaking voices. Are they using their voice to enhance the written word? Does their speaking style align with the tone of their writing? A great speech is where these two voices dance together seamlessly, each complementing the other to convey a message that is not only heard but also felt and remembered.

Oh, those pauses can be pure GOLD, if you know how to use them! Marry them to some great non-verbal facial expressions and you have yourself a home run.

In a world of noise, the pause holds the key. It's not just a break in speech, it's a powerful tool of impact. 🎯

→ The strategic pause: a deliberate silence that captivates attention and adds depth to your message. 

→ The reflective pause: a moment of quiet that invites engagement and reflection from your audience. 

→ The restorative pause: a pause to gather thoughts and refocus, essential for effective communication.

Let's consider this: When you're in the market for a car, do you make a purchase immediately, or do you prefer to take it for a test drive first? You opt for a test drive because you want to experience the car, to understand how it feels, and to gauge your emotional response—do you like it, or not? Now, picture a storyteller in a similar role. They're taking us all on a journey, offering the key to an adventure through their narrative. As listeners, we 'drive' through the twists and turns of the story, connecting with the characters' emotions, and reaching the climax, which helps us decide if this imaginative journey is one we want to commit to.

Icon of the Seas size (Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise Ship) is five times that of the Titanic, Icon of the Seas is around 35% longer than Titanic. Heighten and explore. This is the concept of adding emotion and tension to your story. For example, consider the movie ‘Titanic.’ Director James Cameron heightened the tension of each individual story as the water rose in the ship. You can do the same with your story. Create internal tension in key characters, develop a conflict between them, or increase the obstacles faced, and you heighten audience interest.

They were things like cherry blossoms and bubbles ... swimming pools and tree houses ... hot air balloons and googly eyes and ice cream cones, especially the ones with the sprinkles. These things seemed to cut across lines of age and gender and ethnicity. I mean, if you think about it, we all stop and turn our heads to the sky when the multicolored arc of a rainbow streaks across it. And fireworks -- we don't even need to know what they're for, and we feel like we're celebrating, too. These things aren't joyful for just a few people; they're joyful for nearly everyone. They're universally joyful. And seeing them all together, it gave me this indescribably hopeful feeling

Bait the hook to suit the fish - Means that people need incentive to work. and this incentive will change from people to people. For example, I couldn’t catch a fish with ice cream, even though it is my favourite food. Think about what the fish would want – a worm or a grasshopper. “The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.”

The analogy of a goldfish's reputed 9-second memory span can be related to the way humans process and retain information, particularly when comparing the impact of stories versus hard facts or figures. When you tell a story, it engages listeners on multiple levels – emotionally, intellectually, and sometimes even physically if they are actively participating or imagining the scenario. Stories create a narrative structure that helps information stick to your mind like a post stick to your wall, much like creating a memorable path through a garden that people want to explore and will remember.

On the other hand, presenting dry facts or figures is like throwing pebbles into the water: they might create a ripple, but they sink quickly and are soon forgotten, same as 9-second memory span of a goldfish. When information is presented without a narrative or emotional hook, it is less likely to resonate or be retained, mimicking the way like goldfish swiftly loses interest and moves on.

If we aim to make information stick in our audience's memory, and to creating longer-lasting ripples in a pond, we should embed these facts within stories. By doing so, we appeal to the human brain's preference for narrative, enhancing retention and engagement, much like designing a more intricate and captivating path through that garden, encouraging visitors to linger and remember their experience well beyond those fleeting 9 seconds.

In storytelling, think of the audience as a school of curious fish in the vast ocean, and the storyteller as a seasoned fisherman. Just as the fisherman uses bait to lure the fish, the storyteller uses captivating stories as bait to draw the audience in. The bait, in this case, isn't meant to deceive but to engage and provide a rewarding experience.

"When I weave a tale," the storyteller might say, "I'm casting a line into the waters of your imagination. Each word is like a morsel of bait, designed not to trap but to intrigue, to invite you into a world of wonder. Just as fish might swim closer to a shimmering lure, I want you, my audience, to lean in, to listen, and to be momentarily 'hooked' by the narrative unfolding before you. But fear not, for in this story, being hooked is a journey, a dance of give and take where I strive to enchant you with tales that resonate, entertain, and perhaps even enlighten. So let's dive into the depths of storytelling together, and see what treasures we can discover."

In the art of storytelling, consider the audience as a diverse school of fish, each with unique preferences, and the storyteller as an adept fisherman. The storyteller's tales are like bait, carefully chosen to appeal to the varied tastes within the audience. "Bait the hook to suit the fish," as the saying goes, reminding us that to captivate our listeners, we must offer them what they inherently desire, not what we prefer.

The storyteller might elaborate, "When I craft my stories, I think of what bait will intrigue you, my audience, not just what I find appealing. For instance, I wouldn't use ice cream to catch a fish, even though it's my favorite treat. Instead, I'd choose a worm or a grasshopper, something the fish can't resist. Similarly, in storytelling, I aim to understand and reflect your interests, to offer narratives that resonate with you personally. By aligning my stories with your curiosities and desires, I'm not just telling a tale; I'm providing a path to what you find meaningful and engaging. So, as we embark on this storytelling journey, remember, each word and turn of phrase is chosen with you in mind, seeking to reel you into a world of shared interest and mutual delight."

This enriched analogy emphasizes the storyteller's intent to connect with the audience by offering stories that act as enticing bait, tailored to the audience's diverse preferences, illustrating a deep understanding of and respect for the varied interests that captivate listeners.

HERE ARE 13 UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS ABOUT LIFE 😖

It took over a decade to learn this, but I’ll teach you in five minutes.

1. A salary is a security blanket from your employer. However, if you’re an entrepreneur, it will suffocate your dreams. 
2. If you continue to wait for the “right time”, there will NEVER BE THE RIGHT TIME. You’ll waste your entire life and nothing will happen. 
3. Even when you trust your close friends and family, be careful how much information you give away. Sadly, there are a few people you can trust in this life. 
4. You’ll lose a LARGE majority of close friends if you start upgrading your life. When we elevate away from those we started off with, it will highlight their insecurities and make them feel uncomfortable. They will slowly slip away. 
5. Train yourself to let people win arguments on purpose to conserve your mental health. Protect your peace at all costs. 
6. You become more mature when you train yourself to take nothing personally. People are often at war with themselves, not you.
7. By age 30, your inner circle should be more aligned to the life you want to create, for example focused on making money, health conscious, spiritual or starting a family. 
8. I love self-help books; however, you don’t need 100 self-help books; what you actually you need is to take action, be persistent, then consistent. 
9. I have a degree in Philosophy – yes, I can think outside of the box, but I have not used my degree in my career. The moral of the story is: skills and financial education will make your win, over 97% of those who went to university.
10. You can’t expect honesty from people who lie even to themselves. 
11. People are stuck in toxic relationships because they’re afraid to be alone. I was guilty of this myself, but stepping away and learning to be on my own was a huge blessing in my life. 
12. The most difficult mission on earth is to focus on your dreams; the easiest task is to make excuses and complain. 
13. If you’re not where you want to be in life, change your narrative and get your mind right.

The last piece of advice is: if your life isn’t exactly where it should be and you haven’t reached your full potential - avoid alcohol at all costs and your life will drastically change. 
I have stopped drinking… so watch this space.
