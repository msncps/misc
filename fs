Why the F-Shaped Pattern Matters in Dashboard Design

Let's take a look at two examples: the left scorecard from a match in The Hundred (100-ball cricket tournament), and the right scorecard from a traditional cricket format.

Looking at this scorecard Left Image, it's clear how scattered data can lead to unnecessary eye movement, making it harder to quickly understand the game situation. 

In contrast, the scorecard on the right employs a more linear and systematic design, which aligns with the F-shaped pattern of content scanning. This pattern, modelled by the Nielsen Norman Group, reflects how users naturally scan information: starting at the top left, moving horizontally across the top, and then down the left side in an F-like motion.

In any data presentation, whether it's for sports like cricket or for business dashboards, the layout and organization of information are key to effective communication. The scattered scorecard on the left shows how poor design can detract from the user experience, while the systematic, F-shaped pattern on the right demonstrates how thoughtful design can make all the difference. By aligning scorecard data in a linear, intuitive format, you not only reduce cognitive load but also create a more engaging and enjoyable experience for your audience.
