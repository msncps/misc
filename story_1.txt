When it became clear the Titanic was going down, Isidor and Ida Straus did as requested—the couple put on life jackets and moved to the Boat Deck where officers were lowering lifeboats and instructing women, children, and First Class passengers to board.
According to detailed accounts from Ida's maid and Isidor's work colleague (both surviving eyewitnesses who recounted the story to newspapers at the time) a Third Officer told Ida, who was wearing a full-length mink coat to brave the icy outdoor temperatures, to step onto the lifeboat. She did. When the officer beckoned to Isidor, prompting him to follow, he shook his head. Isidor said, “No I will not get on the lifeboat until I see that every woman and child has a chance to escape.”
The officer recognizing Mr. Straus as the co-owner of Macy’s, offered him a place on the lifeboat 8 but he declined electing to remain on the deck.
According to Archibald Gracie in "The Truth About the Titanic", at first the men tried to get Mrs. Straus into the boat but she would not go without her husband. Then the men all agreed that an old gentleman like Isador should be allowed into the boat. Gracie writes: "'No', he said, 'I do not wish any distinction in my favor which is not granted to the others.' As near as I can recall them these were the words which they addressed to me. 
Seeing this, Ida then climbed back out of the boat and turned to her beloved husband. "We have lived a wonderful life together for 40 years and have six beautiful children together, if you won't get on the life boat, I won't either,” she told him.
She removed her mink coat and handed it her maid, Ellen Bird. "I won't have any further need," she said. "Please take this as you get into a lifeboat to keep you warm, until you are rescued." 
Other sources say Ida stated, "We have lived together for many years. Where you go, I go." 
Archibald Gracie writes, 'They expressed themselves as fully prepared to die, and calmly sat down in steamer chairs on the glass-enclosed Deck A, prepared to meet their fate.' 
Isidor wrapped his arms around her, then, a great wave came over the port side of the ship and swept them both into the sea.
Isidor's body (No. 96) was recovered by the MacKay-Bennett and taken to Halifax. Ida was lost to the sea. (February 6th, 1849–April 15th, 1912) Born on the same day, they died on the same day.

Recognizing Potential
A New York businessman dropped a dollar into the cup of a man selling pencils and hurriedly stepped aboard the subway train. On second thought, he stepped back off the train, walked over to the beggar and took several pencils from the cup. Apologetically, he explained that in his haste he had neglected to pick up his pencils and hoped the man wouldn’t be upset with him. “After all,” he said, “you are a businessman just like myself. You have merchandise to sell and it’s fairly priced.” Then he caught the next train.

At a social function a few months later, a neatly-dressed salesman stepped up to the businessman and introduced himself. “You probably don’t remember me and I don’t know your name, but I will never forget you. You are the man who gave me back my self-respect. I was a “beggar” selling pencils until you came along and told me I was a businessman.”

A wise man said, “A lot of people have gone further than they thought they could because someone else thought they could.” How do you see others? The greatest good we can do for anyone is not to share our wealth with them, but rather to reveal their own wealth to them. It’s astonishing how much talent and ability rests inside a human being. Just as the first step to success is knowing your own potential, the second step is knowing the potential of others. Fortunately, as we recognize our own ability, it’s easy to recognize the ability of others. Once we see it, we can help them discover it for themselves.

Survival Tactics
The giraffe is the largest mammal that gives birth while standing up. I don't speak "giraffe," but I can imagine what the baby giraffe must think when he bounces on the ground from that great height. He just left warm, cushioned quarters in which all his needs, comforts and security were provided. Now he finds himself bouncing 
off (comparatively speaking) hard, cold, unwelcoming ground.


Almost immediately thereafter, a new trauma occurs in the baby giraffe's life. As he struggles to his knees, Mama Giraffe gets busy "persuading" him to stand up. She does this as he wobbles to his feet by giving him a swift kick to prod him to faster action. No sooner does he reach his feet than Mama delivers a booming kick that knocks the baby giraffe back down. . . . I can well imagine the baby giraffe thinking, "Well, make up your mind, Mom! First you kicked me to make me stand up. Then you kicked me back down!"

That process is repeated several times because Mama Giraffe loves her baby. . . . Mama Giraffe knows that the only chance for survival her baby has is to be able to quickly get up and move out of harm's way. Yes, kicking the baby up and down seems like a strange way to show love. But for a baby giraffe it is the ultimate expression of love.

Caution: That approach definitely won't work in the "people" world, but the principle will. Real love is evidenced when you do what is best for the other person, whether or not they appreciate it at that moment. Think about it and I'll SEE YOU AT THE TOP!

Okay - I admit it - this one is extreme. Several years ago before I realized that my body retains ice cream, my wife and I were in our favorite ice cream parlor. An unusual-looking young man walked through the front door. In my lifetime I have never seen anything like it. His hair was sticking out in every direction and came to a point at the top so sharp that it was dangerous. He had every imaginable color represented - green, purple, orange, red, lavender, black - it was really a sight to behold!

Right about now you might think I'm being critical. In reality, I'm not. I am simply reporting what I saw. Actually, I believe the young man had every right to look exactly as he did. That's what America is all about. As a matter of fact, I would go to war to fight for that young man's right to look exactly as he did. You bet I would! However, I would not give that young man a job, regardless of how capable he might be. He would be such a distraction that I don't believe the other members of my staff would get much work done.

Here's the point: It's my conviction that most employers would take the same approach, so when the young man chose to look that way, he chose to eliminate 98% of his employment opportunities. Message: If you want a job, in most places you need to survey the market, observe how the other people appear when they go to work, and within reason, follow their example. In most places substantial latitude is allowed for individuality but there are limits. When you cross the line your chances of employment go down substantially. Think about it. Take the appropriate action and I'll SEE YOU AT THE TOP!
