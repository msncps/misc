Hello,

Apologies for my delayed response. Regarding our discussion about the job opportunity and the compensation, I believe the offer is below the current market rate by about 25% to 27% each month. This is a significant difference for me, as I have major financial commitments, including a mortgage, university fees for my children, among other expenses. I would like to defer my decision until the end of the year and will update you if there are any changes in my circumstances.

Thank you once again for the offer.

Best regards
