Do Schools Kill Creativity? - TED talk delivered by KEN ROBINSON 2009                                               

“Nobody knows what God looks like.” “They will in a minute.”
‘An elementary school teacher was giving a drawing class to a group of six-year-old children. At the back of the classroom sat a little girl who normally didn’t pay much attention in school. In the drawing class she did. For more than twenty minutes, the girl sat with her arms curled around her paper, totally absorbed in what she was doing. The teacher found this fascinating. Eventually, she asked the girl what she was drawing. Without looking up, the girl said, “I’m drawing a picture of God.” Surprised, the teacher said, “But nobody knows what God looks like.” The girl said, “They will in a minute.”

Moral of the story: Don't COPY if you can't PASTE!

A  popular motivational speaker was entertaining his audience.
He Said: "The best years of my life were spent in the arms of a woman who wasn't my wife!" The audience was in silence and shock. The speaker added: "And that woman was my mother!" Laughter and Applause 

A week later, a top manager trained by the motivational speaker tried to crack this very effective joke at home. He was a bit foggy after a drink.. He said loudly to his wife who was preparing dinner, "The greatest years of my life were spent in the arms of a woman who was not my wife!" The wife went; "ahhhh!" with shock and rage. Standing there for 20 seconds trying to recall the second half of the joke, the manager finally blurted out "...and I can't remember who she was!" By the time the manager regained his consciousness,he was on a hospital bed nursing first degree burns from boiling cooking oil.

There's Chinese proverb that says: He who blames others has long way to go on his journey. He who blames himself is halfway there, He who blames no one has arrived. No matter what people did to you, try to no longer put the blame them. Take responsibility for your actions and choose to become a better person

 Renting out your time will not make you wealthy; you must own equity, a piece of a business. Figure out what society wants but doesn’t yet know how to get, then give it to them, at scale. If you learn to build and learn to sell, you will be unstoppable.

Instead of trying to get paid for your skills, find ways to get paid for your judgement, your decision making. You need to build credibility for this, you need to have a consistent and demonstrated track record of wins. When you’re building your brand, focus more on this than on simply inflating your ego on social media.

Read. Read. Read. Read whatever you love until you learn to love to read. It doesn’t matter what you read, it doesn’t matter how much you read, what matters is you read consistently, every day. Over time you will learn to love it and your natural curiosity will take you deeper into domains that interest you. When you get there, read the fundamentals, then re-read them. Most books have one or two points to make, when you get the gist, drop it and move on.

Agatha Christie reported that ideas for her crime stories often came while washing up or having a bath. “I don’t think necessity is the mother of invention,” she wrote in her autobiography. “Invention, in my opinion, arises directly from idleness, possibly also from laziness.”

Our brain has two distinct but integrated systems: the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system

Chances are you will give profound answers such as my goals and dreams in life. This could range from becoming the best in your field, giving a good life to your family, being financially independent, etc.

But if we examine more closely, there are so many things in between your well-thought-out answers and your actual behavior.
Our prefrontal cortex is also known as the cold analytical brain or rational brain. It is our Makatwirang Mak side. When I give you a Math problem, you use your Makatwirang Mak to solve it.

This part of our brain evolved much later compared to the next one we will discuss.

Differentiate among conflicting thoughts
Determine good and bad, better and best, same and different
Predict future consequences of current actions
Work towards defined goals
Act in accordance with social norms
Inhibit action not considered positive
Delay gratification
Perform other complex cognitive functions

Our brain has two distinct but integrated systems: the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system

Our limbic system is responsible for switching on our sense of “doom and gloom” and causes us the “fight or flight” reaction. It is called our hot emotional brain because it can make us impulsive and cause us to do unplanned actions. It has a great deal to do with the formation of our memories. This is the basis for what Maya Angelou (writer, activist, and mentor of Oprah Winfrey) said, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

I thought Steve Job’s last letter was really inspirational, since the stage he’s reached in life is what we all (especially as engineers/tech majors) strive to, but in the end he’s learned that there’s a world outside of what we esteem:

I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes my life is an epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death. You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you. 

Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost – “Life”. When a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading – “Book of Healthy Life”. Whichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down. Treasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends… 

Treat yourself well. Cherish others. As we grow older, and hence wiser, we slowly realize that wearing a $300 or $30 watch – they both tell the same time… Whether we carry a $300 or $30 wallet/handbag – the amount of money inside is the same; Whether we drive a $150,000 car or a $30,000 car, the road and distance is the same, and we get to the same destination. Whether we drink a bottle of $300 or $10 wine – the hangover is the same; Whether the house we live in is 300 or 3000 sq ft – loneliness is the same. You will realize, your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. Whether you fly first or economy class, if the plane goes down – you go down with it… Therefore.. I hope you realize, when you have mates, buddies and old friends, brothers and sisters, who you chat with, laugh with, talk with, have sing songs with, talk about north-south-east-west or heaven and earth, That is true happiness!!

It's like a happy person wants 10,000 things. A sick person just wants one thing.

Dressing one Slice better than the norms; dressing one slice better than anyone else around him
Dressing sloppily could make others perceive you as lazy, unrealilable or even unprofessionals
People judge books by it's cover it's human nature. Human are inntely judgmental and quick to piece together an assumption solely based on what we see not what they see.
Looking sharp and professional indicates that you are competent and professionals

Confucius had a great saying that, “Every man has two lives. And the second starts when he realizes he has just one.” 
That was a great one. Or another one is, “Next time you get sick –” You know, because everybody may get sick every now and then. It’s like, “A happy person wants ten thousand things, a sick person just wants one thing.” Right? So it’s your unlimited desires that are clouding your peace, your happiness, have desires. You’re a biological creature, stands up and says, “I can do something. I move. I resist. I live.”

But just be very careful about your desires. This is the oldest most trite wisdom, desire is suffering. That’s what it means, right? Every desire you have is an access where you will suffer. So just don’t focus on more than one desire at a time. The universe is rigged in such a way that if you just want one thing and you focus on that, you’ll get it. But everything else, you got to let go.

The Law of Reversed Effort:

In a Zen parable that I love, a martial arts student approaches his teacher and asks, “How long will it take me to master this craft?”

The teacher replies, “10 years.”

The student, looking impatient, responds, “I want to master it faster than that. I will work harder than anyone else. I will push myself to practice for many hours every single day. I won’t rest until I become a master. How long will it take then?”

The teacher considers this new information, smiles, and answers, “20 years.”

This story brings to life a concept called the Law of Reversed Effort, coined by author Aldous Huxley:

“The harder we try with the conscious will to do something, the less we shall succeed.”

It’s easy to find examples from your own life where this concept rings true:

When you press to try to complete a creative task, you become less creative.

When you actively push to try to find the perfect partner, you rarely find that person.

When you try to force yourself to fall asleep, you stare at the ceiling awake.

Elite sprinters follow something called the 85% rule:

They try to run at 85% intensity because it keeps them loose, fluid, and effortless.

When they try to run at 100% intensity, their body tenses up and they slow down.

The lesson here is simple: When you adopt a mindset of balanced effort, you achieve greater heights.

Life is not about pushing to the max at all times—this is a recipe for burnout and bad results.

Balance your effort, learn to breathe and flow in everything you do.

If you find that headspace, you will always thrive.

When I ease up on a task, creativity flows more naturally, and solutions come more easily. The 85% rule for sprinters is a great example of how less effort leads to better performance.

bids for connection

Yeah. So really hard season, doing a lot of work, really working on one thing, noticing and responding to bids for connection. And so we’re doing that…

I think you should explain what is bids for connection.

Oh man, I think you should explain what bids for… I mean, I learned it from the Gottman’s.

Yes. It’s a very, actually, the best way, in short, to bids for connection is not just to be nice and, it’s in the middle of a fight, we are having an argument, we are having a fight, and in the midst of this, I’m reading this newspaper, this article… Who reads a newspaper? Article. And I say, “Did you read this?” Or I’m making myself a cup of tea, and I say, “Do you want a cup of tea?” That’s a bid for connection in the middle of conflict. So it’s not just the obvious bids for connection that you make when you say, I think of you, how are you, thank you. It’s the way that you maintain the connection when the thread is frayed.

 Jensen Huang (Founder & CEO of Nvidia) is from 2011
A successful habit is to have the capacity and willingness to learn from just about anybody
Being Indistractable is the skill of the century
advice is to have laser bean focus
don't do too much, do few things well and do those things with extra ordinary intensity and focus matters

1) Open to learning - you don't know it all
2) Focus - choose your goal
3) Intensity - give it all

Wow... thats a mindset that I share with my team. I'm glad there are more people with similar mindset.

The problem with this type of habit is that people are against that because they don't want to learn from anyone. Or from a cocky person, from a negative person, or people that you don like... but that negativity or blocker doesn't allow you to learn every day from ANYONE. You can learn from a friend, family, coworker, executive, neighbor, or even a guy that you don't like! And this is KEY. Have the humility to accept and receive value... people even say... oh... i knew that... Be humble to learn from anyone, even from people you feel are below you

It’s amazing to see how much can be achieved with the right focus and willingness to learn from everyone around you. Mentorship truly makes a difference.

i've enough on my plate

Send this to your “Yes Friends” and let them know how much they mean to you!

A “Yes Friend” is a person who just defaults to saying Yes when you ask them to be there in your life:

- To show up for you
- To sit in the mud with you
- To go on the crazy adventure
- To celebrate and mourn

Find your “Yes Friends” and cherish them.

Be a “Yes Friend” to someone.

Automation is not going to eliminate jobs its going to result in more creative jobs and the important question is how quickly is this transition going to happen and how ready we are, it’s an education problem. 

--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------

Absolutely. And what it does is it frees people up for new creative work. The question is not, is automation going to eliminate jobs? There is no finite number of jobs. We’re not like sitting around dividing up the same jobs that were around since the Stone Age. So obviously new jobs are being created and they’re usually better jobs, more creative jobs.
So the question is, how quickly is this transition going to happen? And what kinds of jobs will be eliminated? What kinds of jobs will be created? It’s impossible looking forward to predict what kinds of jobs will be created. If I told you ten years ago that podcast was going to be a job or that, playing video games going to be a job, or commentating on video games is going to be a job, you would have laughed me out of the room. Those are nonsense jobs. But yet here we are.
So society will always create new jobs, civilization creates new jobs, but it’s impossible to predict what those jobs are. So the question is, how quickly is that transition happening?

It is literally the art of doing nothing. So, all you need to do for meditation is just sit down, close your eyes, comfortable position, whatever happens happens. If you think, you think; if you don’t think, you don’t think. Don’t put effort into it, don’t put effort against it, it’s all you need.

“All of man’s problems arise because he cannot sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes alone.” And it’s very true. I always needed to be stimulated. And when the iPhone came along, bored and was dead. I would never this bored again. If I’m standing in line, I’m on my iPhone, and I thought it was great. And when I was a kid I used to try and overclock my brain like, “How many thoughts can I think at once?” The answer is only one, but I would try to like think multiple thoughts at once.

And I was proud of that. I was proud that my brain was always running, this engine was always moving. And it’s a disease. It’s actually the road to misery. And now that I’m older, I realize that you actually want to, again, rest your mind, you want to learn how to settle into your mind. Now, I look forward to solitary confinement. You’ll leave me alone for a day. It’ll be like the happiest day I’ve had in a while. And that is a superpower that I think everybody can attain.

--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------
Most of modern life, all our diseases are diseases of abundance, not diseases of scarcity. Like old times, I may have starved. You know, old times if I got sugar, that was a wonderful thing. I should have eaten all the sugar to get my hands on. If I’d gotten a piece of news or gossip, that was interesting data that would have helped my life and move me forward. If I’d gotten some brief amount of entertainment, whether through video games or magazines or whatever that would’ve been good.

Now, it’s all disease of abundance. We are overexposed to everything. So, the way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic. It is to retreat from society. There’s too much society everywhere you go; society in your phone, society in your pocket, society in your ears. You’re being socialized right now by listening to this podcast. We’re socializing you. We’re programming you. Everyone’s trying to program everybody. The only solution is turn it off.

Joe Rogan: The only solution is to turn it off and concentrate on your breathing.

--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------
One of the things you were saying is that you feel like happiness is something that you can learn, and then you can teach yourself to be happy, even just by adopting the mindset that you are a happy person and proclaiming that to your friends. And so you’ve sort of developed a social contract. I’m a happy person. And I have to live up to that.

That was the implication. So we kind of know this, right? Social contracts are very powerful. Like if you want to give up drinking, right? And you’re not serious about it, you’ll say, “I’m going to cut back, and then I have only one drink a night, I’m going to only drink on weekends.” You tell yourself. But if you’re serious, you announce it on Facebook. You’ll tell your friends, you’ll tell your wife, you’ll say, “I’m done drinking. I’m throwing everything out of the house. You’ll never see me drink again.” When you say that you know you’re serious

So I think a lot of these are choices that we make. And happiness is just one of those choices. And this is unpopular to say because there are people who are actually depressed, you know, chemically or what have you. And there are people who don’t believe that it’s possible because then it creates a responsibility on them. It says, “Oh now, if I’m — you’re saying if I’m not happy, that’s my fault.” I’m not saying that. But I’m saying that, just like fitness can be a choice, health can be a choice, nutrition can be a choice, working hard and making money can be a choice, happiness is also a choice.

--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------
I can sit around and think my thoughts all day long, but a lot of it’s going to be nonsense. Because there are gaps in thinking where you make leaps, because you’re kind to yourself that you don’t realize you’re making.

People who are talking about AI automating programming have never really written serious code. Coding is thinking, it’s automatic structure of thinking. It’s so overblown. It’s another — it’s a combination of Cassandra complex. You know, it’s fun to talk about the end of the world combined with a God complex, like people who have lost religion so they’re looking for meaning in some kind of end of history

--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------
TLDR, right? Don’t give me the lecture, give me the book. Don’t give me the book, give me the blog post. Don’t give me the blog post, give me the tweet. Don’t give me the tweet — I just — I already know.
And the reality is, I would rather read the best 100 books over and over again until I absorbed them, rather than read all the books. Because your brain has finite information. Finite space. You get enough advice, it all cancels to zero. There’s a lot of nonsense in books out there too. So I don’t read anymore to complete books, I read to satisfy my genuine intellectual curiosity. And it can be anything; it could be nonsense, it could be history, could be fiction, it could be science, it could be sci-fi. These days it’s mostly sci-fi philosophy science because that’s just what I’m interested in, but I will read for understanding.

So, a really good book, I will flip through. I won’t actually read it consecutive in order and I won’t even just finish it. I’m looking for ideas, things that I don’t understand. And when I find something really interesting, I’ll reflect on it. I’ll research it. And then when I’m bored of it, I’ll drop it or I’ll flip to another book. Thanks to electronic books I’ve got 50, 70 books open at any time on my Kindle or iBooks and I’m just bouncing around between them.

BEST CROP

I found my answer when I asked one of these good Samaritans. She told me the story of the BEST CROP. There was a village where a competition was held yearly to decide the person whose crop was the best.

Then news spread that since last many years, the winner was the same old farmer. That intrigued a news reporter and so he went to interview this farmer.

During the interview, the news reporter was further intrigued. That farmer said that each year, he distributed his high-quality seeds with everyone in the village.
“Wouldn’t that drastically reduce your chances of winning the yearly competition?”, the reporter asked.

To which the farmer replied, “If the seeds in the neighborhood are of low quality, then cross-pollination would spoil the crops of the entire village including my own. Having good crops in my neighborhood is only beneficial for all of us!”

I can’t give much back to people who helped me meet the club requirements. Neither can you possibly return the favor to those who helped you.

But, here’s what we can do:

In a world where selflessness is often undervalued, we can remember the lesson of the BEST CROP and strive to cultivate a culture of generosity and solidarity.

That will guarantee a harvest of goodwill that will enrich us all.

Deep listening. Why? Because the listening is not just what happens to the person who listens. The listening is what shapes what the person will tell. The listener creates the speaker, the openness, the, what you divulge, how you connect, how vulnerable you are. And so that’s another way in which the phone becomes a vulnerability withholder. Not just your own, but that of the person that you are with.

Attention is such an undervalued form of love. Attention is an amazing quality because much of the time when people suffer or struggle, they don’t need fixing because some things can’t be fixed and not in the moment. So all they need is a witness. Attention is witnessing.

A Cup of Tea
Once, a long time ago, there was a wise Zen master. People from far and near would seek his counsel and ask for his wisdom. Many would come and ask him to teach them, enlighten them in the way of Zen. He seldom turned any away.One day an important man, a man used to command and obedience came to visit the master. “I have come today to ask you to teach me about Zen. Open my mind to enlightenment.” The tone of the important man’s voice was one used to getting his own way.

The Zen master smiled and said that they should discuss the matter over a cup of tea. When the tea was served the master poured his visitor a cup. He poured and he poured and the tea rose to the rim and began to spill over the table and finally onto the robes of the wealthy man. Finally the visitor shouted, “Enough. You are spilling the tea all over. Can’t you see the cup is full?”

The master stopped pouring and smiled at his guest. “You are like this tea cup, so full that nothing more can be added. Come back to me when the cup is empty. Come back to me with an empty mind.”

The lesson is all of us have preconceived ideas, about the things we want to learn; the true wisdon is that we really don't know anything. Inorder to grasp anything or new you need to open our hand, then you need to let go;

His name is Sylvester Stallone. One of the BIGGEST and Most famous American Movie superstars. Back in the day, Stallone was a struggling actor in every definition. At some point, he got so broke that he stole his wife's jewelry and sold it. Things got so bad that he even ended up homeless. Yes, he slept at the New York bus station for 3 days. Unable to pay rent or afford food. His lowest point came when he tried to sell his dog at the liquor store to any stranger. He didn't have money to feed the dog anymore. He sold it at $25 only. He says he walked away crying.

Two weeks later, he saw a boxing match between Mohammed Ali and Chuck Wepner and that match gave him the inspiration to write the script for the famous movie, ROCKY. He wrote the script for 20 hours! He tried to sell it and got an offer for $125,000 for the script. But he had just ONE REQUEST. He wanted to STAR in the movie. He wanted to be the MAIN ACTOR. Rocky himself. But the studio said NO. They wanted a REAL STAR.

They said he "Looked funny and talked funny". He left with his script. A few weeks later,the studio offered him $250,000 for the script. He refused. They even offered $350,000. He still refused. They wanted his movie. But NOT him. He said NO. He had to be IN THAT MOVIE.

After a while, the studio agreed, gave him $35,000 for the script and let him star in it! The rest is history! The movie won Best Picture, Best Directing and Best Film Editing at the prestigious Oscar Awards. He was even nominated for BEST ACTOR! The Movie ROCKY was even inducted into the American National Film Registry as one of the greatest movies ever!

And do You know the first thing he bought with the $35,000? THE DOG HE SOLD. Yes, Stallone LOVED HIS DOG SO MUCH that he stood at the liquor store for 3 days waiting for the man he sold his dog to. And on the 3rd day, he saw the man coming with the dog. Stallone explained why he sold the dog and begged for the dog back. The man refused. Stallone offered him $100. The man refused. He offered him $500. And the guy refused. Yes, he refused even $1000. And, Believe it or Not, Stallone had to pay $15,000 for the same, same dog he sold at $25 only! And he finally got his dog back!

It is easy to become overwhelmed and frustrated by happenings and non-happenings in your life and lose track of the path. It’s easy to fall into a routine and lose heart when faced with challenges, obstacles and the unknown. In such moments, all that one can really do -knowing that the future will unfold no matter what- is to take the next step. “Just take the next step that you can see. “Just take that.”

Remember …

“You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.” –Martin Luther King Jr. I Have a Dream speech (1963)

I got really fascinated by the way you read because I thought there was something wrong with me by doing that.
But you don't really just read a book to completion.
You read and then you pick something else up and you just kind of go based on your whims, whatever you're interested in.
I was raised by a single mom in New York and she used the local library as a daycare center because it was a very tough neighborhood.
And so she would basically say, when you get back from school, go straight to the library and don't come out until I pick you up late at night.
So I used to basically live in the library and I read everything.
I read every magazine.
I read every pictograph.
I read every book or every map.
I just ran out of stuff to read.
I just read everything.
So I got over this idea of that reading a large number of books or reading a book to completion as a vanity metric.
Because really when people are putting up photos on Twitter, Instagram, look at my pile of books that I'm reading, it's a show off thing.
It's a signaling thing.
And the reality is I would rather read the best hundred books over and over again until I absorb them rather than read all the books.
Because your brain has finite information, infinite space.
You get enough advice, it all cancels to zero.
There's a lot of nonsense in books out there too.
So I don't read anymore to complete books.
I read to satisfy my genuine intellectual curiosity.
And it can be anything.
It could be nonsense.
It could be history.
It could be fiction.
It could be science.
It could be sci-fi.
These days it's mostly sci-fi philosophy science because that's just what I'm interested in.
But I will read for understanding.
So a really good book, I will flip through.
I won't actually read it consecutively in order.
And I won't even just even finish it.
I'm looking for ideas, things that I don't understand.
And when I find something really interesting, I'll reflect on it.
I'll research it.
And then when I'm bored of it, I'll drop it or I'll flip to another book.
Thanks to electronic books, I've got 50, 70 books open at any time in my Kindle or iBooks and I'm just bouncing around between them.
It's also a little bit of a defense mechanism to how in modern society we get too much information too quickly.
And so our attention spans are very low.
So you get Twitter, you get Instagram, you get Facebook, you're just used to being bombarded with information.
So you can take that to, you can view that as a negative and be like, I have no attention span or you could view that as a positive.
I multitask really well and I can dig really fast.
If I find a thread that's interesting, I can follow through five social networks, through the web, through the libraries, through the books, and I can really get to the bottom of this thing very quickly.
It's like the library of Alexandria that I can research at my disposal.
So I no longer track books read or even care about books read.
It's about understanding concepts.
Yeah, you brought up two awesome points.
First of all, the social media aspect of books and basically anything.
It's such a weird way to display your life because you're displaying the best aspects of your life and some sort of a glass case.
It's an unrealistic version of your life that you cultivate and you curate.
And I'm as guilty of that as anybody.
Everybody's guilty of it.
I'm guilty of it too.
I pose with my dog every time I run.
We're always signaling.
It's like rather than really looking at yourself, you're looking at how other people look at you.
So it's like this one, remove mental image.
And it's kind of a disease because social media is making celebrities of all of us and celebrities are the most miserable people in the world because they have this strong self image that gets built up.
It gets built up by compliments.
Every time somebody pays you or me a compliment and we're like, oh, well, thank you.
Then that builds up an image of who we are.
And then one idiot comes along, one out of 10, one out of 100, and they can easily tear it down because it doesn't take many insults to cancel out a lot of compliments.
And now you're carrying around this big weighty self image and it's just very easy to be attacked.
And because you're famous or you're well known, people want to attack you.
So being a celebrity is no good.
It's actually a problem.
Like one of my tweets is, and these are all reminders to myself, is you want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous.
There's benefits to it.
Of course, of course.
But we wouldn't do it.
It has unusual problems that you don't get trained for and you really will not understand unless you experience it.

One of the things that you were saying is that you feel like happiness is something that you can learn, and then you can teach yourself to be happy, even just by adopting the mindset that you are a happy person and proclaiming that to your friends.
And so you've sort of developed a social contract.
I'm a happy person.
And then, well, I have to live up to that.
Yeah, I've got hundreds of techniques.
But the more...
How did you develop that one?
There's social consistency, right?
Humans have a need to be highly consistent with their past pronouncements.
So the way I started my first tech company was I was working inside a larger organization, and I told everybody that I was going to go start a company.
I was like, I hate this place.
I'm going to do my own thing.
I'm going to be a successful entrepreneur.
Six months pass, nine months pass, then people start...
You're still here?
I thought you were going to go start a company.
Were you lying?
Right.
That was the implication.
So we kind of know this, right?
Social contracts are very powerful.
Like if you want to give up drinking, right, and you're not serious about it, you'll say, I'm going to cut back.
I'm going to have only one drink a night.
I'm going to only drink on weekends.
You tell yourself.
But if you're serious, you'll announce it on Facebook.
You'll tell all your friends.
You'll tell your wife.
You'll say, I'm done drinking.
I'm throwing everything out of the house.
You'll never see me drink again.
When you say that, you know you're serious.
So I think a lot of these are choices that we make, and happiness is just one of those choices.
And this is unpopular to say because there are people who are actually depressed, you know, chemically or what have you.
And there are people who don't believe that it's possible because then it creates a responsibility on them.
It says, oh, now if I'm, you're saying if I'm not happy, that's my fault.
I'm not saying that, but I'm saying that just like fitness can be a choice.
Health can be a choice.
Nutrition can be a choice.
Working hard and making money can be a choice.
Happiness is also a choice.
If you're so smart, how come you aren't happy?
How can you haven't figured that out?
That's my challenge to all the people who think they're so smart and so capable.
If you're so smart and capable, why can't you change this?
There are a bunch of people though that actually take pleasure in being miserable.
There's something about the pursuit of excellence and of success that supersedes all other pursuits that in their eyes, it is the peak, the pinnacle, the most important thing.
It's not a trade off.
I would argue that if, now when I say happy, happy is one of those words that means a zillion different things.
It's like love, right?
What does that mean?
Well, I love cheese.
Yeah.
I'm going to define it a little bit more tightly.
So let's go back to desire, right?
This is old, old Buddhist wisdom.
I'm not saying anything original, but desire to me is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.
And I keep that in front of mine.
So when I'm unhappy about something, I look for what is the underlying desire that I have that's not being fulfilled.
It's okay to have desires.
You're a biological creature.
You're part on this earth.
You have to do something.
You have to have desires.
You have a mission, but don't have too many.
Don't pick them up unconsciously.
Don't pick them up randomly.
Don't have thousands of them.
My coffee is too cold.
It doesn't taste quite right.
I'm not sitting perfectly.
Oh, I wish it were warmer.
You know, my dog pooped in the lawn.
I didn't like that.
Whatever it is.
It's not one overwhelming desire.
It's okay to suffer over that one.
But on all the others, you want to let them go so you can be calm and peaceful and relaxed.
And then you'll perform a better job.
Most people, when you're unhappy, like a depressed person, it's not that they have a very clear, calm mind.
They're too busy in their mind.
Their sense of self is too strong.
They're sitting indoors all the time.
Their mind's working, working, working.
They're thinking too much.
Well, if you want to be a high-performance athlete, how good of an athlete are you going to be if you're always having epileptic seizures, if you're always like twitching and running around and like jumping and your limbs are flailing out of control?
The same way, if you want to be effective in business, you need a clear, calm, cool, collected mind.
Warren Buffett plays bridge all day long and goes for walks in the sun.
He doesn't sit around like constantly loading his brain with nonstop information and getting worked up about every little thing.
We live in an age of infinite leverage.
What I mean by that is that your actions can be multiplied a thousandfold either by broadcasting at a podcast or by investing capital or by having people work for you or by writing code.
Because of that, the impacts of good decision-making are much higher than they used to be because now you can influence thousands or millions of people through your decisions or your code.
A clear mind leads to better judgment, leads to better outcome.
A happy, calm, peaceful person will make better decisions and have better outcomes.
If you want to operate at peak performance, you have to learn how to tame your mind just like you have to learn how to tame your body.
I love what you're saying.
Warren Buffett might not be the best example because he drinks like I think six Coca Colas a day and he eats mostly McDonald's.
He's still alive somehow.
That's amazing.
That shows you that low stress is more important than low stress.
He looks like shit.
How old is he?
I mean, he's a fairly old man.
Charlie Munger is, I think, in his 90s, right?
He's made it really far.
I wonder what Warren's doing.
He's got it.
No, that's bad for him.
It's terrible.
But he doesn't care.
He doesn't care.
I think he's just low stress.
Stress is a big killer.
Right.
So he just enjoys that Coca Cola.
Maybe there is a trade-off, right?
Maybe him enjoying that junk food and that Coca just, ah, that pleasing of the mind is maybe better than him just eating wheat grass shots and- Yeah, and being miserable.
And being salas and just being, yeah, just super worked up about everything.
It's like if you need your glass of red wine to de-stress and calm down, that's probably better than you flying off the rails.
Right, right.
And I think that that's applicable not just in business, but in probably any pursuit.
And I like what you're saying about allow that one thing to be your obsession.
But everything else just, you know, learn how to let things go.
Pick your battles.
And we like to think that we like to view the world as linear, which is I'm going to put in eight hours of work.
I'm going to get back eight hours of output.
Right.
It doesn't work that way.
Guy running the corner grocery store is working just as hard or harder than you and me.
How much output is he getting?
What you do, who you do it with, how you do it, way more important than how hard you work.
Right.
Outputs are non-linear based on the quality of the work that you put in.
The right way to work is like a lion.
You and I are not like cows.
We're not meant to graze all day.
Right.
We're meant to hunt like lions.
We're closer to carnivores in our omnivorous development than we are to herbivores.
Don't tell vegans that.
Yeah, sorry.
Look, I wish all that stuff worked.
I don't want to eat meat.
Future generation will look back at us as worse than slavers, you know, because of the Holocaust we're committing with the animals.
But they'll have artificial meats that taste in our healthier, better than the real thing.
So allegedly.
Allegedly.
But so as a modern knowledge worker athlete, as an intellectual athlete, you want to function like an athlete, which means you train hard, then you sprint, then you rest, then you reassess, you get your feedback loop, then you train some more, then you sprint again, then you rest, then you reassess.
This idea that you're going to have linear output just by cranking every day at the same amount of time, that's machines, you know?
Machines should be working nine to five.
Machines are not meant to work nine to five.
No, I agree wholeheartedly, but for people that are working for someone, there's not really that option.
So that's unfortunately the rub, right?
That's kind of where my tweet storm starts, which is, first of all, the first thing if you're going to make money is that you're not going to get rich renting at your time.
Even lawyers and doctors who are charging $300, $400, $500 an hour, they're not getting rich because their life starts slowly ramping up along with their income, and they're not saving enough.
They just don't have that ability to retire.
So the first thing you have to do is you have to own a piece of a business.
You need to have equity, either as an owner, an investor, shareholder, or a brand that you're building that accrues to you to gain your financial freedom.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who was always chasing after more. He wanted a bigger house, a fancier car, and more money in the bank. He thought that if he could just accumulate enough things, he would finally be happy. But no matter how much he acquired, he always felt like something was missing.

One day, Jack heard a wise saying: "Happiness is the balance between what you have and what you want." This made him stop and think. He realized that he had been so focused on what he wanted that he had forgotten to appreciate what he already had.

Jack decided to make a change. He started by taking stock of all the good things in his life: a loving family, good health, and a comfortable home. He realized that he had been taking these things for granted and that they were worth more than any material possession.

Next, Jack decided to help others. He volunteered at a local charity and found that giving back was a great way to find happiness. He also started to focus on experiences rather than things. He took his family on a camping trip and found that the memories they made together were more valuable than any possession.

Over time, Jack found that he was happier than he had ever been before. He had found the balance between what he had and what he wanted. He realized that happiness was not about having more, but about appreciating what you already have and giving back to others.

In conclusion, the story of Jack teaches us that happiness is not about accumulating more things, but about finding balance in our lives. By appreciating what we have and giving back to others, we can find true happiness and fulfillment.
You do that one very small podcast where you just have small, like three or four minute clips.
Yeah, so what it was, I did a Tweetstorm called How to Get Rich Without Getting Lucky, and it got pretty popular on Twitter.
And it's really about wealth creation.
I just use the clickbaity title.
And it's trying to basically lay out timeless principles of wealth creation that if you absorb them, you become the kind of person who can create wealth, create business, make money.
And my theory behind that is there are three things everybody wants.
There's actually more than three, but let's just start with three, the three basics.
Everybody wants to be wealthy, everybody wants to be happy, and everybody wants to be fit.
And I know there's a lot of virtue signaling that goes on, like we don't want money, and I don't care about being happy, and happiness is for stupid people.
But let's face it, you want to be rich and happy and healthy.
That's the trifecta.
Now, of course, you also want an internally calm state of mind, you want a loving household.
So there are other things that come into it.
But those three, I think they can actually be taught, right?
And a fitness, I'm not going to teach.
There are a lot of people who you've had on here, including yourself, who know a heck of a lot more about fitness and health than I do.
But I was born poor and miserable, and I'm now pretty well off, and I'm very happy.
And I worked at those.
And so I've learned a few things.
There are some principles.
And so I try to lay them out, but in a timeless manner, where you can kind of figure it out yourself.
Because at the end of the day, I can't really teach anything.
I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks so you can remember things when they happen or put a name to them.
So this podcast actually ended up explaining this tweet storm.
So there's a tweet storm with like 36, 38 tweets, got very famous, got translated dozens of languages.
And these were principles that I came up with for myself when I was really young, around 13, 14.
And I've been carrying them in my head for 30 years, and I'd been sort of living them.
And over time, I just realized, like, sadly or fortunately, the thing that I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that, and do it in a very long term kind of way, not the banker, crash the economy, get billed out kind of way.
But build businesses and help people and provide value kind of way, especially when applied to modern technology and leverage in this age of infinite leverage that we live in.
So the podcast is just explaining each tweet.
So these are little three, four, five minute snippets.
I don't like to say the same thing twice.
I don't like to explain in detail.
I feel like if you have something original and interesting to say, you should say it.
Otherwise, it's probably been said better.
So that podcast tries to be information dense.
It tries to be very concise.
It tries to be high impact.
It tries to be timeless.
And it has all the information.
I think you need the principles that if you absorb these and you work hard over 10 years, you get what you want.
So I've got the one on wealth creation.
I'm going to attempt to do one on happiness is a big word, but, you know, happiness and inner peace and calm and all that.
Because what you want is you don't want to be the guy who succeeds in life while being high, strong, high stress and unhappy and leaving the trail of emotional wreckage with you and your loved ones, which is more common than not because you got to focus and it's very hard to be great at everything.
You want to be the guy or the gal who gets there calmly, you know, quietly without struggle.
You want to be the person who's the, when there's a crisis going on, you want to be the calmest, coolest cucumber in the room who still also figures out the correct answer.


--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx

I 
 was dealing with a question of stupid topic, but the meaning of life.
Right?
What's the meaning?
How could that be stupid though?
Well, in a sense...
It's trite.
It's trite.
You're not supposed to think about it.
It's something you ask your parents when you're young.
They tell you don't worry about it or they say...
Go get a job hippie.
Exactly.
Go get a job you freaking hippie.
Or here's God.
God is the meaning of life, right?
And so I was just trying to resolve for myself, like, what could the answer be?
Right?
Not what is the answer, but what could the answer be?
And so at a core level, I was forced to kind of hunt down all these weird little things and really understand for myself.
And it's got to be personal, right?
But I have to establish for myself what it could and could not be.
And that gave me some level of peace.
So now I don't have to keep asking that question.
What is the meaning of life?
I mean, I think the question is more interesting than the answer.
Everyone should explore this on their own, but let me just explore a few parts with you.
Right?
So first is, if I gave you an answer, if I said the meaning of life is to please God, well, which God?
Okay.
Judeo-Christian God.
Well, okay.
Why that one?
Why this thing?
The problem is it's a why question.
You can keep asking why forever, right?
Any answer I give you, you'll just ask why again.
Why again?
Why again?
That's right.
And you end up in a place called Agrippa's Trelemma.
Okay.
This is a philosophical exercise, but I kind of thought it through.
Then googled around and there's a thing called Agrippa's Trelemma.
And Agrippa's Trelemma says that any questioning like this, the why, will always end in one of three places.
Okay.
First is infinite regress.
Right?
Why?
Because of this.
Why that?
Why that?
And just keep going forever.
The second is circular reasoning.
Well, A.
Why A?
Because of B.
Well, why B?
Because of A.
Right?
You get trapped in that.
Or the third is an axiom.
And the most popular axiom is God, but it could be anything because of math, because of science, because of the Big Bang, because of simulation.
Right?
These are all axioms.
These are all just stopping points.
Saying simulation, we're in a simulation or saying it's the Big Bang.
It's just another way of saying God.
It's just God's a dirty word.
So we don't use it as much anymore, but same thing.
So you end up in one of these three dead ends, essentially.
Right?
So there is no answer.
The real answer is because.
Right?
What is the meaning of life?
Yeah.
You get to make up your own answer is the beauty.
If there was a single answer, we would not be free.
We would be trapped because then we would all have to live to that answer.
Then we'd be bored like robots, each one competing with each other to fulfill that single meaning more than the others back to signaling.
Like I'm better at it than you are.
But luckily, there is no answer.
So you just do whatever you want.
The meaning of life.
It's funny that.
That that's the basis of all existential angst that you don't.
You don't know why you're here.
And you have this feeling that it could be meaningless.
It is.
I mean, if you when you start pondering the multiverse, the universe, the galaxies, the solar system, the planet, the organism, the cells inside the organism, the bacteria, the parasites, the symbiotic relationship we have to our environment.
And you start going, Jesus Christ, am I just a little piece of this thing?
It's like.
Well, the answers to all the great questions are paradoxes.
Yeah.
So for example, you're asking like, do I matter?
That's like really the question you asked, right?
Well, how do I matter in this infinite universe?
Well, you know, on the one hand, you're separate.
No two points are the same.
Every point is every two points are infinitely different.
You're completely separated.
No one will have your thoughts, your emotions, your feelings, your experience.
So your life is a single-player game.
You're trapped inside your head and you're just aware of a bunch of things going on and that's it.
On the other hand, I cannot say the word Joe Rogan without invoking the entire universe.
Joe Rogan, alien comes along says, what's that Joe Rogan?
What's Joe Rogan?
It's a human.
What's a human bipedal ape?
What's an ape on the earth?
What's the earth planet?
What's a planet solar system?
Where was the carbon made inside stars, right?
Instead, I have to create the entire universe to just say the words Joe Rogan.
So in that sense, you're connected to everything.
It's inseparable.
So the answer to that question of do I matter is I am nothing and I am everything.
And you'll find this with all the great questions.
The answers are all paradoxes, which is why at some level, it's sort of pointless to pursue them to find a trite answer like I'm giving.
But the act of pursuing them is actually really useful because then it gives you certain intrinsic understanding in your life that brings a level of peace.
--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx--------xx----------xx

T
here's also these traps that people sort of establish in their own mind of giving themselves excuses or giving themselves insurmountable obstacles, insurmountable paths and terrain.
Victim mentality.
Yes.
It's somebody else's fault.
It's my skin color's fault.
It's the system's fault.
Yeah, those people are sinking.
I feel bad for them.
I want to shake them out of it and say, actually, you can get out of it.
You just have to stop thinking.
It's everybody else's fault.
You have to alter the perspective.
Yeah.
But it's so difficult for people to do.
It's one of the most difficult things for people to do is to change the way they approach reality itself.
At the end of the day, I do think, even despite what I said earlier, life is really a single player game.
It's all going on in your head.
Whatever you think you believe will very much shape your reality, both from what risks you take and what actions you perform, but also just everyday experience of reality.
If you're walking down the street and you're judging everyone, you're like, I don't like that person because their skin color.
I don't like that.
Oh, she's not attractive.
That guy's fat.
This person's a loser.
Oh, who put this in my way?
You know, the more you judge, the more you're going to separate yourself.
And you'll feel good for an instant because you'll feel good about yourself.
I'm better than that.
But then you're going to feel lonely.
And then you're just going to see negativity everywhere.
The world just reflects your own feelings back at you.
Reality is neutral.
Reality has no judgments.
To a tree, there's no concept of right or wrong or good or bad.
You're born.
You have a whole set of sensory experiences and simulations and lights and colors and sounds, and then you die.
And how you choose to interpret that is up to you.
You do have that choice.
So this is what I meant that happiness is a choice.
If you believe it's a choice, then you can start working on it.
And I can't tell you how to find it because it's your own conditionings that are making you unhappy.
So you have to uncondition yourself.
It's just like, I can't fix your eating habits for you.
You can give you some general guidelines, but you've got to go through the hard habit forming of how to eat right.
But you have to believe it's possible.
And it is absolutely possible.
I was miserable.
I'm happy as a clam.
And it's not just the money I got there before the money.
You got happy before the money?
Mostly, yeah.
How did you get happy before the money?
I started getting older.
I just realized, like, life is short.
I'm going to die.
Again, trite, right?
Trite.
In many ways.
Yeah, well, Confucius had a great saying that every man has two lives.
And the second starts when he realizes he has just one.
Wow.
And I read that.
It was one of those book-dropping lines.
It's like mic drop.
Confucius had a lot of mic drops.
Confucius was a bad motherfucker.
He was.
That's a crazy one.
That was a great one.
Or another one is next time you get sick, because everybody gets sick every now and then.
It's like a happy person wants 10,000 things.
A sick person just wants one thing.
So it's your unlimited desires that are clouding your peace, your happiness.
Have desires.
You're a biological creature that stands up and says, I can do something.
I move.
I resist.
I live.
But just be very careful of your desires.
This is the oldest, most trite wisdom.
Desire is suffering.
That's what it means, right?
Every desire you have is an access where you will suffer.
So just don't focus on more than one desire at a time.
The universe is rigged in such a way that if you just want one thing and you focus on that, you'll get it.
But everything else, you've got to let go.
Did you make a gradual shift to happiness, or was it a radical change?
It's ongoing.
It's gradual.
Every day gets better.
So you're happier today than you were a month ago.
Yeah.
Allegedly.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm very happy these days.
Deliriously so.
It's actually hard for me to hang out with normal people.
Really?
So you've made a significant shift over the period of like how many years?
Probably about eight years.
Eight years.
Wow.
And is this something that you've pursued through certain books, or is it just like you've made an understanding or gained an understanding in your own mind and then started pursuing it based on that understanding?
Yeah, it's very, very personal.
It's basically you have to decide it's a priority.
And then I tried every hack I possibly could.
I used to.
You know, I tried meditation.
I tried witnessing.
You know, I even tried a necessary eye just to see what it would feel like.
How did it feel?
It turned me from a pessimist to an optimist, but I didn't like the physical side effects, nor did I want to be in a drug-first sustained basis.
So I dropped it.
But did it turn you into an optimist?
Yes.
Interesting.
At the time, I used to be a pessimist, yeah.
I started doing things like I would start looking at the, you know, in every moment and everything that happens, you can look on the bright side of something, right?
And so I used to do that forcibly, and then I trained it until it became second nature.
So for example, like a friend of my wife's was over, and she, when we were dating, and she took all these photos, she took like hundreds of photos, and then she sends them all to us.
And my immediate reaction was like, why are you dumping hundreds of photos of my phone?
I don't need hundreds of photos.
I have some judgment.
That was my immediate reaction.
And then I could say, actually, how nice of her.
She sent me hundreds of photos.
I could pick the one that I like, right?
There are two ways of seeing almost everything.
There are a few things that are like high suffering, so you can't do that, other than just saying, well, this is a teacher, right?
But I slowly worked through every negative judgment that I had until I saw the positive.
Now it's second nature to me.
I also realized that like, what you want is you want to clear minds.
You want to let go of thoughts.
Happy thoughts disappear out of head automatically.
Very easy to let go of them.
Negative thoughts linger.
So if you interpret the positive in everything very quickly, you let it go, right?
You let it go much faster.
Simple hacks get more sunlight, right?
Learn to smile more, learn to hug more.
These things actually release serotonin in reverse.
They aren't just outward signals of being happy.
They're actually feedback loops to being happy.
Spend more time in nature.
You know, these are obvious.
Watch your mind, watch your mind all day long.
Watch what it does.
Not judge it, not try to control it, but you can meditate 24 seven.
Meditation is not a sit down, close your eyes activity.
Meditation is just basically watching your own thoughts like you would watch anything else in the outside world and say, why am I having that thought?
Does that serve me anymore?
Is that conditioning from when I was 10 years old?
Like for example, getting ready for this podcast.
You got ready?
I didn't.
Oh, good.
I did, but I did, but I did.
I couldn't help it.
And what happened was the few days leading up to this, my mind was just running.
And normally my mind is pretty calm and it was just running and running and running.
And every thought I would have, I would imagine me saying it to you.
My brain couldn't help but rehearse what it's doing.
It's just rehearsing all the time to talk to you.
And then I was even rehearsing, telling you about the rehearsal.
So it was all playing all these meta games.
And I was just like, shut up, stop it.
What is going on?
And it took me a while to figure out, oh yeah, you know what it is.
When I was a kid in Queens and I had no money and I had nothing and I needed to save myself, the way I got out was by sounding smart, not being smart, sounding smart.
That was the skill I perfected.
So I am hardwired to always rehearse things so I will sound smart.
It's a disease, it keeps me from being happy.
But when you see that, when you realize that, when you understand something, then it naturally calms you down.
So after that I stopped rehearsing as much.
But it's still a train habit.
That is a really interesting point that you want to sound smart.
That many people do that and especially young people.
When you see someone who is smart or someone who appears smart, they say smart things, you kind of want to sound smart.
I want people to think about me the same way I think about that person.
That is my disease, that is my feeling.
It is what clutters my mind.
The thing I have to ask myself now is, if I can, would I still be interested in learning this thing if I couldn't ever tell anybody about it?
That's how I know it's real.
That's how I know it's something I actually want to know.
That's a common thing though.
I know I suffered from that when I was young, the desire to sound smart.
That's, it's very common.
All of us start out, everything you're a winner now in your life, you're a, it's because you were a loser at some point.
If you had gotten all the girls, if you had all the money, if you had everything you want, you were good looking in junior high or high school, you wouldn't have done anything with your life.
And you would have peaked early.
It's like the Bruce Springsteen, Glory Days song, right?
You would have married your high school sweetheart, you'd be living in your hometown, you'd be a manager at the local McDonald's, whatever the first dream job you had.
Thank God we didn't all get what we wanted when we were young, right?
Or we would be trapped in that.
So you have to be able to break out of where you came from.

People who are talking about AI, automating programming, have never really written serious code.
Coding is thinking.
It's automating structure thinking.
An AI that can program as well or better than humans is an AI that just took over the world.
That's endgame.
That's the end of the human species.
And I can give you arguments why I don't think that's coming either.
People who are thinking, and I know I take the opposite side from some very famous people in this debate, but we're nowhere near close to general AI.
Not in our lifetimes.
You don't have to worry about it.
Even in our lifetimes.
Really?
It's so overblown.
It's another...
It's a combination of Cassandra complex.
It's fun to talk about the end of the world combined with a God complex like people who have lost religion so they're looking for meaning in some kind of end of history.
The reason why I don't think AI is coming anytime soon is because a lot of the advances in so-called AI today are what we call narrow AI.
They're really pattern recognition.
Machine learning to figure out what is that object on the screen or how do you find this signal and all of that noise.
There is nothing approaching what we call creative thinking.
To actually model general intelligence, you run into all kinds of problems.
First, we don't know how the brain works at all.
Number two, we've never even modeled a paramecium or an amoeba, let alone a human brain.
Number three, there's this assumption that all of the computation is going at the cellular level at the neuron level, whereas nature is very parsimonious.
It uses everything at its disposal.
There's a lot of machinery inside the cell that is doing calculations, that is intelligent, that isn't accounted for.
The best estimates are it would take 50 years or more's law before we can simulate what's going on inside a cell near perfectly and probably 100 years before we can build a brain that can simulate inside the cells.
Looking at it saying that I'm just going to model a neuron as on or off and then use that to build a human brain is overly simplistic.
Furthermore, I would posit there's no such thing as general intelligence.
Every intelligence is contextual within the context of the environment that it's in, so you have to evolve an environment around it.
I think a lot of people who are peddling general AI, the burden of proof is on them.
I haven't seen anything that would lead me to indicate we're approaching general AI.
Instead, we're solving deterministic closed set finite problems using large amounts of data, but it's not sexy to talk about that.
If you're talking about mirroring the actual abilities of cells, or are you talking about recreating the actual mechanism?
What is going on inside cells and biological organisms?
We just don't know how intelligence works.
Right.
We literally have no idea.
Most of the AI approaches basically say we're going to try and model how the brain works, but they model at the neuron level, which is saying this neuron's on, that neuron's off, they're combining their signal.
But I'm saying the neuron is a cell.
Inside the cell, there's all this machinery going on that's operating the neuron that is also part of the intelligence apparatus.
You can't just ignore that and abstract that out.
You have to model it down to the inside the cell level.
It's also a part of the biological organism itself.
Exactly.
And it has all these needs that the biological organism has to have food and rest and there's a balance going on.
But when you eliminate all that, when there is none of that, and it's just calculations, and we get to a point where it's just this thing that we've created, whether you call it a computer, whether it doesn't have to be a moving thing even, but a thing that you've created that stores virtually all the information that's available in the world, stores all the patterns of all the thinking of all the great people that have ever lived, all the writers, all the people that have ever published anything, all the people that have ever spoken any words, stores all of their points, all of their counterpoints, all their contradictions, applies logic and reason and some sort of sense of the future and starts improving upon these patterns and then starts acting on its own based on the information that's been provided with.
Well, first you would have to actually simulate a structure of the human brain that can hold all that information.
You're basically talking about tens of thousands of brains worth of information.
We can't even build one brain the next decade or two or three.
Well in terms of an actual physical brain, yes.
But what about something that recreates the abilities of a brain?
Like I said, nature is parsimonious.
So we've got this three pound wetware object that can hold all this data.
Nature has been very efficient in evolving kind of how we get there.
I just don't think computers are anywhere close to that.
Like they can hold that amount of data with that complexity, with like the holographic structure of the brain where it can recall in many, many different ways.
And then I don't think you can evolve a creature to be intelligent outside of the boundaries of feedback in a real medium.
Like if you evolved, if you raised a human being a concrete cell with no input from the outside, they wouldn't have any feedback from the real world.
They wouldn't evolve properly.
So I think just dumping information into a thing isn't enough.
It has to have an environment to operate in to get feedback from.
It needs to have context.
But isn't that biological?
I mean if you have just all the information that people have accumulated and the lessons that people have learned and you program that into the computer.
Like if we can take a computer that can beat someone at chess, the real question was, well can we make some sort of an artificial intelligence that can beat someone at Go, which is far more complex at chess.
They figured out how to do that too.
And that was a giant shock.
Right?
These are still man made very closed bounded games.
They're not on the road to the unbounded game of life.
They are completely artificial.
But this didn't Go, didn't that give you like a little bit of a pause?
A little bit.
They're not Go or League of Legends or Fortnite.
They're not completely deterministic.
But they're still very artificial, very bounded games.
Being good at Go doesn't mean that you can then suddenly figure out how to write great poetry.
Right.
The creativity for sure is something that's great.
Creativity is the last frontier.
So I do believe that automation over a long enough period of time will replace every non-creative job or every non-creative work.
But that's great news.
That means that all of our basic needs are taken care of.
And what remains for us is to be creative, which is really what every human wants.
Yeah.
And what are you doing right now?
This is a creative job.
Sure.

There's no room for nuance when you're dealing with these political battlegrounds, when you're dealing with right versus left and one side has a clearly established stance that you're supposed to take.
Like gun control is a great example of that, right?
There's no room for what about mental health?
What about the fact that so many of these people are on psych medication?
Right.
Why is that not being discussed?
We're running one of the greatest mental health experiments in history when we're doping everybody up on SSRIs.
And maybe if you give 30 million people SSRIs, maybe like 29.9 million are a lot happier, and then you have a fraction that commits suicide or detonate.
You're basically trading the mean for the variance.
You have blow up risk.
Yeah, there's no room for nuance, which is why I stay out of politics largely.
Do they drag you in though sometimes?
They always try.
Even this conversation is going to force you to get dragged in.
I'm sure there's going to be some people there.
Here's the thing about politics.
We have a first pass the post system.
What that means is that whoever wins 51% of the vote in this country gets a lot of the power, right?
It's not like proportional representation where the Greens have 10% and the Libertarians have 3% or whatever.
It's just like you're all Democrat in power now, all Republican.
Because of that, to win, you have to pick one of these two sides, right?
You have to choose.
You can't just basically say, I'm going to be nuanced about it.
You can't vote for a third party that's throwing away your vote, right?
I have a friend who's trying to fix that.
He's starting this thing called a good party where you kickstart your vote.
You combine all your votes, you hold them in reserve, and then when you have enough to win, then you vote that person in power, right?
So you don't throw away your vote.
But outside of those hacks, we're never going to get a third party elected.
So because of that, all of your beliefs have to neatly fit into the Democrat bundle or the Republican bundle.
And so when you get into that tribe, if you signal outside of that bundle, you get attacked.
So it's literally making you into an unclear thinker.
It's making you into a muddled thinker.
If all of your beliefs line up into one political party, you're not a clear thinker.
If all your beliefs are the same as your neighbors and your friends, you're not a clear thinker.
You're literally just, your beliefs are socialized.
They're taken from other people.
So if you want to be a clear thinker, you cannot pay attention to politics.
It will destroy your ability to think.
What dread?
Most of modern life, all our diseases are diseases of abundance, not diseases of scarcity, right?
Old times I may have starved.
You know, old times if I got sugar, that was a wonderful thing.
I should have eaten all the sugar to get my hands on.
If I got in a piece of news or gossip, that was interesting data that would have helped my life and moved me forward.
If I'd gotten some brief amount of entertainment, whether through video games or magazines or whatever, that would have been good.
Now it's all diseases of abundance.
We are overexposed to everything.
So the way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic.
It is to retreat from society.
There's too much society everywhere you go, society in your phone, society in your pocket, society in your ears.
You're being socialized right now by listening to this podcast.
We're socializing you.
We're programming you.
Everyone's trying to program everybody.
The only solution is to turn it off.
The only solution is to turn it off and concentrate on your breathing.

You know you should really get started but you can’t. What if you make the wrong choice? What if you start it out the wrong way, and it all gets ruined? You start to feel that weight in your stomach, that tension in your chest, as you feel a little panic about the idea of going forward.

Maybe it’s best to just hold off for a bit. Sleep on it a little more. Get some more feedback. Figure out what the “right” thing to do is. Plan it all out, until it makes sense. That tension you were feeling starts to melt away.

Analysis paralysis is a specific kind of procrastination. You feel some aversion to going forward. You convince yourself that the problem is that you haven’t given it enough thought, done enough research or really figured things out enough to get started. As you mentally shift the idea of taking action into the future, your tension subsides you delay it some more.


Analysis paralysis is also really hard to overcome because, it’s not always harmful. Sometimes you do need more research. Sometimes you shouldn’t make a decision out of haste. Sometimes holding out for the best possible option is really better than jumping out right away.

Here I would like to relate to a story in Mahabharata.

“ Once Guru Drona tied a demo Bird on a tree and asked his “novice archers “
to shoot at its eye.
He then asked each of them on
what they could see ?
Not satisfied by the answers of
Yudhisthira, Duryodhan and Bhim ,
Guru Drona asked Arjuna what he was focusing on ,

𝗔𝗿𝗷𝘂𝗻𝗮 𝘁𝗼𝗹𝗱 ~
“ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘆𝗲” . 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝘆𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗶𝗿𝗱 ! “

And that was the target .

There was no distraction.

For Neeraj ,
👉the Eye is the Gold Medal 🥇
👉He is focused on that ultimate goal .
👉No distractions distract him .

Huge huge learnings !

If I have to sum it up for our golden boy ,

In the summer of 2017, I found myself facing an unexpected challenge – redundancy. Like many others, I was blindsided by the news. However, little did I know, this setback would become the catalyst for my greatest triumphs.

Instead of succumbing to despair, I made a conscious decision to view this setback as an opportunity for growth.

- The first step was to rebuild my confidence. I reached out to my network, seeking guidance and support.

- I explored new industries and roles that aligned with my skills and passions.

- Each rejection became a stepping stone towards self-discovery, leading me closer to my true calling.

- I invested in myself, seizing every opportunity to upskill and expand my knowledge. Through online courses and certifications, I honed my expertise, preparing myself for the challenges that lay ahead.

Today, as I reflect on my journey, I am filled with gratitude for the setbacks that once seemed insurmountable. They were not obstacles, but rather, opportunities in disguise.

Moral of the story.......In the face of adversity, resilience is not just a trait – it's a superpower. And with it, we have the power to transform setbacks into stepping stones towards success.

So embrace the uncertainty; it's where new opportunities lie. Keep pushing forward; your resilience will lead you to success.
