My most important rule for life: Don’t complain about anything.

If it’s within your control, go do something about it. If it’s not, complaining is just a waste of energy.

When you complain, you’re giving too much power to the thing.

Take back that power.

A hill I'll gladly die on: Walking in silence is more productive than walking with a podcast or audiobook on 2x speed.

Simple challenge for all of you:

Go for a 15-minute tech-free walk every single day this week.

• No phone
• No podcasts
• No audiobooks

Just you and your thoughts.

It’s a simple reset that’ll unlock new creativity and shift your perspective.

The best parenting advice I ever received:

Make a list of all of the principles and values that you want your child to live by, then go out and actually embody them yourself.

If you want your child to treat your wife like a queen, you’d better treat your wife like a queen.

If you want your child to embrace delayed gratification, you’d better embrace delayed gratification.

If you want your child to do hard things, you’d better do hard things.

Children learn by absorbing. You do not teach a child something by telling them how to do it—you teach them through showing them how it’s done.

Rule: Live the truth you want your child to embrace.

An old story on happiness that I can’t stop thinking about…

A teacher asked her students to write their names on balloons and release them into the room.

She then asked them to find the balloon with their name on it, but none of them could.

She then asked them to take the first balloon they found and give it to the person whose name was on it. They completed the task in seconds.

The teacher concluded:

The balloons represent your happiness. Search for your own happiness and you may not find it, but help others find theirs, and you will find yours too.

A mentor told me this years ago and I’ll never forget it:

There’s someone out there living the life you want simply because they took action and you didn’t.

You don’t need more information. If information were the problem, everyone would be rich, fit, and madly in love.

Your entire life will change the moment you stop gathering more information and start acting on the information you already have.

A lost suitcase created one of the greatest writers in history...

This story blew my mind:

In 1922, Ernest Hemingway was a 23-year-old aspiring novelist working as a foreign correspondent in Paris for the Toronto Star newspaper.

The young Hemingway, who was recently married and embracing the culture of Paris, would work for the paper during the days and then work on building his body of fiction work at night.

In December 1922, a bit of carelessness (and bad luck) led to a creative tragedy:

While traveling to visit her husband, who was on assignment in Switzerland, Hemingway's wife, Hadley, lost the suitcase that contained every single one of his novel manuscripts and copies.

It was a devastating blow to the writer, who had spent years working on the pieces.

Note: I can't imagine how this must have felt. I get extremely frustrated when I lose a few minutes of work due to an issue with Microsoft Word or the WiFi...imagine losing years of work just like that...

But rather than be completely derailed by the challenging blow, Ernest Hemingway found a way to benefit from the chaos:

Feeling new time pressure, he made his writing more concise, using fewer words, shorter sentence structures, and tighter paragraphs.

As it turns out, that shift in style dramatically improved his overall writing quality and output. To this day, Ernest Hemingway is known for his writing style that involved short sentences and simple language.

Hemingway's Lost Suitcase is a perfect example of a challenge that was turned into an opportunity with a growth mindset.

Adaptability is essential (and it's a skill you can build).

"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent. It is the one most adaptable to change." - Charles Darwin

Life is chaotic. If you can embrace that chaos and roll with it, you'll find a way to win.

Your entire life will change the moment you stop looking for more information and start acting on the information you already have.

I’m speaking from experience here:

I spent years gathering information and avoiding action.

In hindsight, I can admit I was using the information gathering to hide from my fear of action.

Dopamine from information gathering is a dangerous drug.

Get your dopamine from action.

Harsh Truth: There’s someone less qualified than you living the life you want simply because they took action and you didn’t.

(And sorry, but shaving your head and saying “monk mode” doesn’t qualify as taking action.)

Pay attention to the actions, not the words. Words deceive, actions rarely do.

A question to unlock your future: What am I not achieving simply because I haven't asked?

When Steve Jobs was 12 years old, he cold-called Hewlett-Packard co-founder Bill Hewlett and asked for spare computer parts. It led to a summer internship and further stoked a curiosity that never went away.

The story offers an important reminder: Closed mouths don’t get fed.

There is something in your life that you deserve but haven't achieved, simply because you haven't asked for it yet.

If you want something—and you’ve done the work to earn it—go ask for it.

Worst case—you’re told no.

Best case—it’s yours.

Most of the people you admire are willing to help. They received help on their journey and want to pay it forward. But you have to do the work to earn that help.

The old adage to sit back and wait for good things to happen is terrible advice. A little push goes a long way.

Stop following paths that other people have created for you. 

One thing I've learned: 

If you're carving your own path, there will be long periods of time when no one believes in you.

• They'll call you crazy.
• They'll say you've changed.
• They'll say you've lost your mind.
• They'll say you'll never make it.

Don't get discouraged, don't get upset, don't be disappointed.

It's not their fault. They just don't understand. They can't see it yet.

Don't try to explain it.

Just do it.

Success is the best proof of concept.

Success is hard to ignore.

Lesson: Don't talk, just show them the receipts.

This is an important truth I’ve learned…

The nature of your stress:

Stress is the result of not having a clear plan to close the gap between your expectations and your present reality.

Once you have the plan, the stress goes away, as it just becomes about daily execution, which you know you can handle.

This observation comes from my own life:

My periods of maximum stress and anxiety were the periods when I had yet to see a clear path to closing the gap between where I was and where I wanted to go.

Lots of potential energy, no path to convert it into kinetic energy.

In my experience, the most interesting part of this is the start of the phase change from stress to energy.

It’s the moment when you start to figure it out—when you start to have a clear plan that you can execute against.

Stress down, energy up. Winning begets winning.

When you find yourself experiencing stress and anxiety about your situation, it’s often just an information gap.

You need to gather information on how to close the gap between present reality and future expectations.

Then you need to act on that information.
