Please find the report link for further validation. Kindly note that the recent dataset you shared had a filter criterion that differed from what we discussed previously. Therefore, I have kept the same criteria we agreed upon during our initial requirement gathering session. Additionally, the requested change won't be possible as the audit trail data from the system is not available. If you'd like to review the report or discuss how the logic is built, feel free to let me know, and we can arrange a discussion over Teams. Thanks.
